EXPERIENCE  I began to *feel* some guilt
EXPERIENCE I *feel* sorry for you Nardo
EXPERIENCE I *felt* the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that its too late to save itself
EXPERIENCE It *feels* just like it was before
EXPERIENCE I still *feel* a little woozy
EXPERIENCE I *felt* pain under my jaw
EXPERIENCE I *felt* a tug on the back of my shirt
EXPERIENCE then I *felt* the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said
EXPERIENCE  I *felt* a warm touch on my cheek
EXPERIENCE I *felt* my leg turn
EXPERIENCE there is no need to *feel* troubled
EXPERIENCE he *felt* sorry for them
EXPERIENCE suddenly she *felt* a sharp pain in her jaw
EXPERIENCE Ms. Schaefer *felt* intense pain
EXPERIENCE yet we no longer *feel* uneasy
THINK I *felt* like I was a big part of the team
THINK they got help where they *felt* they needed it most
THINK the team *felt* that they could part with the player
THINK she *feels* that many pain specialists receive inadequate training
THINK they *felt* that the police could not guarantee their safety
THINK I have always *felt* that I fitted in there
THINK your doctor *feels* that leg surgery is the best way to treat it
THINK many people have *felt* that they don't have any power
THINK I *felt* that I had so much to prove to my team
THINK we *felt* like it was starting to be taken from us
THINK Jack *feels* he is hurting Boston's chances
THINK he *feels* this is the least risky path

    "\n",
    "Some word sequences are rare, for example the sequence \"My iguana is on fire\", and even the initial \"my iguana\" may be so rare that in a corpus, you may never have seen the combination. In that case, a bigram language model would assign the sequence \"my iguana is on fire\" the probability zero, because $P(iguana|my) \\approx \\frac{count(my, ~iguana)}{count(my, ~\\_)} =  0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, \"my iguana is on fire\" is still a valid sequence of English words. \n",

    "There is a technique that is standardly used to fix this problem, called \"smoothing\". The idea is: Let's make it so that the probability of $P(iguana|my)$ is not zero but a small nonzero number, say 0.0001. Then the probability of the overall sequence will not be zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if we view the probability mass of 1 as a whole cake, then we had previously divided up the whole cake among word pairs that we have actually seen in the corpus. If we want to give \"iguana|my\" a small slice of the cake, there is some event that's going to get less cake, a.k.a. probbility. So in smoothing, we give a bit less probability mass to all observed events (where an event is here a bigram), and distribute the extra probability mass among unseen events. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest smoothing strategy is \"add-one smoothing\", where we simply \"hallucinate\" an additional count of one for every event. So events that were previously unseen now have a count of one, and events that were previously seen have an extra count of one. Since we have hallucinated some extra corpus data, we need to put that extra data into the denominator of the MLE estimation so that probabilities overall add up to one again.

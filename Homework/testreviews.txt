I need to preface this review with the comment that I am not a John Wayne fan. However "The Searchers" is often said to be the Duke's best movie. And it is clear from here that he was no cardboard cut out actor and, if anything, his real talents were underused in his career. Still "The Searchers" is a classic and deserves to be better known. The 50th anniversary edition is a must for any collector. The restored print for the DVD is excellent. Just what you want to watch John Ford's gorgeous Monument Valley location shots. The "extras" disk is also excellent. There are three good documentaries all of which were made with thought and genuine concern. A change from all those "afterthought" DVD extras. One documentary features interviews with Martin Scorsese and another some great shots of the film production camp in Monument Valley in the early 1950s, before it was on the tourist trail. The documentaries would be of interest to serious film students and even amateur sociologists, they illustrate the many serious social issues "The Searchers" deals with, and takes a serious and humane point of view on, without preaching. A lesson I suppose for today's "socially concerned" film makers, they really need to focus on the film making and the story first. John Ford did and the message is powerful and still relevant today
Even though it tends to drag and the abuse gets a bit repetitive, this is by far the best adaptation of the famous British Navy story. Gable and Laughton are perfect for their respective roles and the period is brilliantly displayed. I'm not a huge Gable fan. This and Gone W/ the Wind are abt all I like him in
If you loved this movie, try 50 First Dates. The surprising chemisty from Drew and Adam continues in that movie. I love the humor and the 80s clothes!! :-
A solid series until the end. Even though this season the deaths are not important it centers more on the families. It was sad to see the serise end but it is probably the series finale ever.
What's not to like about Richard Farnsworth? He was one of the few actors that received nothing but compliments during his acting days, an extremely likable "old man." Hey, few people every remember seeing this guy as anything but old, since he spent his younger days as a stuntman, rather than as an actor. So, he was a very good choice to portray a likable thief: Bill Miner, the last of the stagecoach and train robbers. "The Gentleman Bandit," I believe, was his label. This is a nice low-key adventure, with almost no bad language and the British Columbia and Washington state scenery is absolutely gorgeous. It would look great on widescreen DVD. What's the holdup? (pun intended) The only bad news of this tale is the usual filmmakers' twisted message to root for a man who simply was a crook, nothing else. The film also - especially to get the younger audience - needs more action. It will be too slow for them, but I liked it, if for no other reason that I can listen to Farnsworth's voice all night. What a "cool" guy he was, and it''s always a pleasure to see him on screen.
To Anchor Bay Entertainment: If you release The Grey Fox on DVD we'll buy it! This is truly a great film. Five stars is as good as it gets. Can you ask for more incentive than that?
Few days ago, I watched the documentary "Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession" (2004) about a channel that had brought the great and unavailable anywhere else films to its 100, 000 lucky subscribers in LA in 70s - 80s. While enjoying the clips from many Foreign and Independent movies that were the best part of documentary, I was able to recognize the movie that I saw many years ago in Moscow and still remember well, I could not only recall the title. I remember that the movie was Dutch, very erotic - in the raw, brutal, twisted yet beautiful and passionate way. Watching "Z Channel..." I was happy to instantly recognize "Turks fruit" (1973) aka "Turkish Delight" made by Paul Verhoeven in 1973. I checked with Netflix, the movie was available; I bumped it up in my queue and just finished watching it. My memory served me well - Verhoeven's early film is as naturalistic, earthy, brutal, erotic, humorous, poetic, poignant, and captivating as I remember it. Based on the novel by Jan Wolker, "Turkish Delight" stars young, hot, very sexy (and I mean it - VERY SEXY) Rutger Hauer as a bohemian free spirited and often cruel sculptor Eric and even younger Monique van de Van as his wife Olga, child-like yet as sensual as Eric was, "the light of his life, the fire of his loins". The film that describes their stormy relationship has become the most financially successful Holland's film that was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film and was proclaimed by Jan Wolker a "75% masterpiece". There are not very many directors in the world that can create the atmosphere of raw sensuality as well as Verhoeven (of his Dutch period, especially). Verhoeven is known for uncompromising approach to his work, fiery temperament, and aggressive movie-making. Joe Ezsterhaus who worked with Verhoeven on two films said about him: "The guy is like his movies: brilliant, mercurial, very daring, perverse, a wonderful series of paradoxes and contradictions..." "The Turkish Delight" is all that and I love it but I can understand how its graphic sexuality, more than one disgusting and revolting scenes (but they had to be in the movie) and crude behavior may put off a lot of viewers. Be prepared, "Turkish Delight" is delightful but it is very intense and often not easy to watch.
If there was ever a movie that exposed the hypocrisy and meanness in people, this would be it! Mrs. O'Hara, beautifully played by Mia Farrow, doesn't trust Edwina, the new beauty that's come to town. The two battle it out, with Edwina coming out the loser in the end. Or does she? If I said any more, I'd be spoiling the story. Just watch this movie, and enjoy. Things are never what they seem, and I promise the ending will be worth staying for
He highlights the concepts very well, for example the chapter on ball striking, i never knew this concept in 2 years of playing golf. Must watch, this DVD is made of several small chapters that have meaningful titles, therefore on the second viewing u can jump to the chapter that requires repeat viewing
This movie was not only subject to some good acting by some great actors, it was also a well written tale of of young woman who grew up too soon. I feel like I know Miss Holiday a whole lot better now
Ladyhawke is a big step ahead of most fantasy flicks. It seems to have all the usual bits: knight on a mysterious quest, lovable thief, and a loving couple under a vicious curse. Even these ordinary pieces rise above ordinary in this film, due largely to the outstanding cast: - Rutger Hauer (the knight, of course), - Michelle Pfeiffer (the other half of the cursed couple), - Matthew Broderick (knave with a heart of gold), and - Leo Kern (aging hermit, in on the terrible secret). Saying much more would mean saying too much, but it has the fairy tale ending you'd hope for and expect - good guys get theirs and the bad guys get theirs. One thing about this movie (or maybe the DVD transfer) truly annoys me, however. Someone messed with the colors, like a newbie camera geek who just discovered gradient filters, and hasn't learned how garish they can be. To whoever did it: please get someone with normal color vision to check your work next time. Outside of that, it's a safe, entertaining movie. Enjoy! --wiredweir
I first saw this film back in 1987 over at a high school friend's house and have loved Isabeau and Navarre ever since. This movie has it all: comedy, drama, and one amazing love story. Who's heart didn't break on that one scene when the doomed couple could catch a glimpse of each other at sunrise? Navarre's devotion was utterly breathtaking. A wonderful, wonderful film
Since I was a child I have patiently anticipated the battle of evil versus evil. It was discussed in school yards and in the lunch room, at slumber parties and later when I started working as a clerk in a grocery store. It was a never ending argument- Who would win in the battle of Freddy and Jason? In my youth children spoke of some underground video tape that contained a battle between the two monsters, but I don't think that it ever existed and if it did I have never laid my eyes on such a relic, but finally the horror movie to end all was released onto the big screen and later on to DVD. It was everything I hoped for. There was blood, brief nudity and really bad jokes. That is the unholy trinity of horror. The plot wasn't horrible, it was actually pretty good for a fright flick. Freddy hasn't graced the silver screen since 1994 when Wes Craven presented "New Nightmare" and he kept his integrity intact in my opinion. Jason Vorhees on the other hand made the space film "Jason X" as his last trip to the theatres, and if you haven't seen it yet don't bother you didn't miss much. I liked how the movie gave a back story to Jason's life at Crystal Lake and it showed that Krueger is conniving and manipulative with getting Jason to go along with his plan to kill on Elm Street once again. Obviously Jason is a big dumb animal and does not need much convincing. The cinematography and directing were excellent, I thought the music was done well, and most importantly the film stayed true to the original story line. The only thing that upset me was after all these years waiting for this battle to come I was wrong about who would be victorious.
Jason X (as in Friday the 13th Part 10) sheds light on a familiar, though not too friendly, face: that of Jason. A "miracle of science," Jason, is to be transported from a maximum-security facility to a research lab. The transfer goes awry and he's once again up to no good before being cryogenically suspended. Things become a bit complicated when in the year 2455 a spaceship arrives from Earth II (!) and revives the masked lunatic... The plot, the setting, the acting, and the dialogues are all very good. It's just too bad the cutest girl gets whacked first... In a nutshell, Jason X is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, as long as you're in that kind of a mood.
after the worst "friday" movie of all time(and thats saying a lot) the series bounces back (nine years later) with this fun and nice change of pace for the series is just what the doctor ordered.having been caught and chained by the goverment, jason escapes killls everyone but one fine looking doctor who "buck rogers" like freezes jason and her self in the underground lab they are at. flash foward to 2455 and earth,now unliveable, is visited by a group of students who free jason and the doctor from the lab. before you can say "CEH CEH CEH"( the best way i can spell the theme song) jason is loose on the starship and cutting apart the crew. like i said the novel setting and the use of some great f/x make this one of the best of the series
This is a fantastic history of the Blues! Unlike any of the other recent documentaries, the stories are related in this show entirely by the artists. There is no narrator and the feel of the show is very personal! Add to that some great music and you have a winner
John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono were guests on the Dick Cavett show three times in 1971. Their first apearance was taped on Saturday, September 11, 1971 and was John's first interview after the Beatles had disbanded. The subsequent interviews were taped on Friday, September 24, 1971 and Thursday, May 11, 1972. Viewers, Beatle fans and their counterparts will undoubtedly enjoy the natural conversational flow among Dick Cavett and his guests. John appeared to be in his element, happily chatting with the famous talk show host. It was a good thing John rightfully defends Yoko during this interview and makes it quite plain that she did not break up the Beatles. She has been wrongfully blamed for something that was bound to happen naturally - after all, the individuals who made up the Beatles needed to move individually; grow; develop their own individual styles. The group could not last forever. Cavett gives John and Yoko equal time. He listens to them attentively; takes them seriously and at no time criticizes anybody or speculates about anybody. It is very easy to forget the interviews are taking place before a studio audience as viewers are easily lulled into the flow of the conversation. Yoko is very animated during this first interview. She smokes; chats easily with her host about her undergraduate days at Sarah Lawrence and shows a film she made. John and Cavett are actually funny, sharing some humorous observations about clothing and coiffure. Be sure to get this dvd collection. It is funny; interesting; serious; thought provoking and memorable. This is something for everybody and not just Beatle fans, Yokophiles and Lennonophiles. The bonus dvd will certainly bring many smiles to many faces.
Boy, did this movie suck at the beginning! And boy, did it just get better and better from there on in. Even the Oriental humor, which is usually so awful, was actually funny at times. The action sequences, while a little too often fanciful, were very impressive, even innovative. Chow is a talented guy. Having seen this I'm interested to see what his earlier work is like. If you like martial arts/action/weird comedy, you'll love this
Certainly the best kung-fu movie I've ever seen, Kung Fu Hustle is loaded with effects and humor, and stunning fight sequences to boot. Try and watch any regular martial arts movie afterward and all you can do is yawn, even the great Bruce Lee is tired and played-out in comparison to Kung Fu Hustle. The movie continues to top itself throughout, with an escalation of fight scenes that peaks with the hero jumping higher than the clouds, seeing Buddha, lightly stepping off a bird, and plunging to earth to deliver a blow capable of knocking a fifty-foot hole in a building! This aint just wire-fu, it's wired-fu with hilarious weirdness.
I know what you're thinking. If you're anything at all like me, when this movie was in the movie theaters and the previews were running rampantly, I thought this looked like the stupidest piece of trash to ever grace the big screen. But I'll admit readily when I'm wrong, and here I absolutely was. I'm not saying Little Nicky is the world's greatest film, or even comedy, but if you like Adam Sandler and silly comedies in general, this is a movie that won't disappoint when you desperately need something mindless to turn your brain into mush after a horrendous week (or even day) at work. A movie that opens with Jon Lovitz acting like a big, horny bird in a tree certainly promises to be very entertaining. And it is. And we're taken straight to hell with Harvey Keitel playing the devil himself very nicely, a brief encounter with Dan Marino, and the late Rodney Dangerfield to name a few. We're also treated to the heavens above with Reese Witherspoon and the guy who played Adam Sandler's golf mentor in Happy Gilmore. This movie has everything it takes to be insanely silly and entertaining. And you'll LOVE what happens to Hitler in this. Don't take it too seriously. If you do, you miss the entire point of Little Nicky. If this is your kind of movie, add it to your collection...you'll watch it many, many, many times again. Enjoy
It is the best movie I have ever seen. It was so funny. Adam Sandler is the best actor in the world which makes it even better. I saw it at my friend's house. I would watch it again but I don't have it. Little kids under 6 should not see this movie. You will defiantly like this movie. That is why you should buy this movie. Jason M
I bought this season of Survivor (I never saw this season) but it was very, very good. I'm glad that Jon lost and Sandra won! I was shocked when they let outcasts back into the game. I'm glad that Lill came back. But I was mad that Burton came back! 4 stars
"Annie Hall" is one of the most acclaimed romantic comedies of all time. The film not only holds a place on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#31), as well as The American Film Institute's Top 100 Comedies (#4). The film took home 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director; The film is also without a doubt one of the best romantic-comedies ever made. It really nails that awkwardness of romance. I think few of us are like the neurotic Woody Allen and I don't so much mean the way the characters act, but the way they think and stuff like that is totally realistic. Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, a comeddian who always knocks it out of the park when it comes to comedy but can't really get a grip on love. He's been through two marriages and is a little bit neurotic, which turns people off. Then his friend Rob (Tony Roberts) introduces him to Annie Hall (the wonderful Diane Keaton). Annie is a little bit ditzy and not quite as smart as Alvy, but the two click and begin a relationship that (to say the least) has it's share of ups and downs. Now, not only is the plot and the dialogue and everything true-to-life but this film is also absolutely hilarious. When I see a movie on AFI's Top 100 Comedies, I tend to shy away from the films on that list. Not because they're not good, it's just that they don't really pick by what's the funniest film ever. Example, 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' was funnier than their number 1 pick Some Like It Hot. But anyway, Annie Hall actually is very funny. The dialogue is quick-witted, some the scenes have become classics (Allen sneezing on the cocaine). In an era where romantic comedies run rampant into movie theatres, it's nice to go back and see the films that really made the genre what it is. This is a great film, a great romantic-comedy, a Woody Allen masterpiece. GRADE: A
Not dissin the USA tour, but i loved the Europe Tour DVD better, after i saw this one. This DVD was a nice Eminem introduction to seeing his concert behind the scenes for me. I can relate to his music madness and Anger issues, it did give me fan comfort while i did homework lessons and Detroit love. I passed it along for other college woman to view~LMAO I hope i get it back~LMAO Amazon.com is so amazing, i can just order another one. Chinastar
Unfairly overlooked in the early 90's for rideing at the tale end of the last wave of 80's slasher films 'POPCORN(1991)' is a damn good little slasher flick with a somewhat dry but exceptable endind,some decent acting,a ludicrous story,some good dark atmosphere,decent kills,plenty of cheese and a pretty creepy villain. The parody of a slasher film being set in a movie theatre is excellent and Wes Craven and the makers of 'SCREAM' owe alot to this little known gem for slurping up some inspiration
What more can you ask for (Lou Monte doing LUNA LUNA LUNA, it's here). POPE is Vincent Patrick's best written work and his screenplay works with Rourke and Roberts doing each other justice in the lead roles. The inside buzz is Michael Cimino sat in the directors chair, but evidence to the contrary is offered: The film is less than 3 hours in length and significantly lacks metaphors. Instead, POPE is a raucous and likeable tale of NYC bottom feeders whose only place in Trump Tower would be behind a broom. Geraldine Page gives an Oscar nominated supporting turn one year before her Best Actress win for TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL. She's more enjoyable here
Man,talk about your untypical,not your average,regular kung fu movie!!Steven Chow blew the audiences away with this super hit.For those who have'nt seen it yet,it's a treat you simply cannot miss.Excellent dvd for anyone to add to their collection of favorites
I wouldn't write yet another review of War and Peace if I didn't have something new to say about it, namely, War and Peace and War by Peter Turchin. Near the end of Turchin's book, about bringing the scientific method to the rise and fall of empires, he quotes extensively from the parts of Tolstoy's War and Peace. Tolstoy, with his ratio analysis of various Napoleon Grand Armee metrics to Russian army metrics, was grappling with a theory of mathematical history well over a hundred years ahead of his time. Pick up Turchin's deep book, and afterwards read War and Peace, paying particular attention to Turchin's and Tolstoy's ideas. You will never see historical dynamics the same again. Sincerely, Alex Alaniz PS--Read the book--the movie isn't so good--and please see the reviews of my own strong science fiction book: Beyond Future Shock about the near-terms perils and promise of advanced bio/nano technology in a world still roiled with Middle Age religious conflict and ever growing extreme wealth gradients
This cartoon gives me the entire memories when i use to watch them as a little kid.The DVD may not have the great special features,But if you ever see this sucker available in a store don't think about it just buy it
I've been a Christie fan since childhood and loved the early movies in spite of Rutherford's handling of the character. I loved Joan Hickson's portrayal of Miss Marple and never thought anyone else could "be" Miss Marple for me. Therefore I expected to be disappointed with these new releases. I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED, I LOVE THIS NEW VERSION! After I cautiously viewed the first episode I came to fully appreciate Geraldine McEwan in the role. She is subtle, confident and highly adroit and I find her refreshing and wonderful. The stories themselves are entertaining and intriquing. Some reviewers complained that the scripts don't stick to the originals, but this is not an issue for me here. Christie's stories stay alive and fun even after having been done so often because they aren't always done the same way. Any tweaks to the storylines keep the material fresh and even improve it at times. I think it's fun to be surprised by my old favorites! Hooray for Geraldine McEwan! I hope to see many more Miss Marple stories with her in the title role
Released during the andquot;Just Say Noandquot; 1980s, this film is a cautionary tale of drug abuse. Lenny is a guy just trying to stake his claim in the world, to make a little money. He soon impresses a big wheel who moves Lenny and his wife to California where they are at first overwhelmed by the opulence but then become willing participants in it. Lenny continues to buy, buy, buy until it all crashes down. When the money stops rolling in, he is introduced to cocaine and the story then takes a dramatic turn as we watch Lenny lose it all. James Woods is fabulous as Lenny. I've seen this movie many times and now that I'm writing about it, I think it's time to pop this one into the VCR for another viewing
Quite a bit of what I see on the few TV channels I let my kids watch depicts either *borderline* behavior or is so vacuous I cannot stand it. This series has a plot, good writing and good production values. It has the added benefit that I can also stand to watch it. I am hoping the second season maintains the quality of the first
I'm the biggest "Wuthering Heights" fan I know (ask anyone who knows me, and they'll tell you I borderline annoying with the subject). Having money left over from my birthday, I decided "Hey, why not buy yet another Wuthering Heights DVD?". I was a little skeptical about how it would be, seeing as all the adaptations I've seen thus far haven't really taken the whole story into account. Of course, to do so would be a hard task for a movie. The story is complex and not a very average-movie-goer sort of plot. I was disappointed in the 1992 version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes, although it's a good enough movie (as long as it didn't have Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights as the title...). Other versions were all right, and although the 1939 version didn't showcase the second generation of the story, I found it better than '92. Needless to say, when I popped in the DVD, I was hooked by the first five minutes. Sure, the movie isn't EXACTLY like the story (I want you to show me a movie that is. And, as I said, this story is complex for the movies). Some of the things that are different/changed/added/etc., are the fact that, once again (as in many of the movie adaptations) Nelly is old from the start. Also, Heathcliff and Cathy are older than when most of the scenes in the story take place (such as when they visit the Lintons). Most "Wuthering Heights" fanatics know that Heathcliff and Cathy never consemate their relationship. However, there's many a kiss in the movie. There are some other details of the movie that are different than the story, but I, a crazy "Wuthering Heights" and Bronte admirer, give this movie a bravo and would recommend to any other fan
It wouldn't surprise me if this movie is shown in more high school civics classes than any other movie: it's rife for debate. Gary Cooper might stick his neck out once for this bunch of frightened citizens in the face of adversity, but when he throws his badge down onto the dusty street at the end, we know he'd never do it again. Sure he took an oath to uphold justice and does it because "I have to," and all that; but only a fool would think that a place like Hadleyville deserves protection. Can you imagine Clint Eastwood in Cooper's shoes? At least that would be one side of the argument after the movie was shown. Of course the other side of the debate would say it has nothing to do with Hadleyville and its cowardly citizens, but has everything to do with Cooper and his code of honor. Isn't this the same Gary Cooper who played Frederic Henry in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, based on Hemingway's novel, a writer who also dealt a lot with personal codes of honor and "courage under fire," a character who says in the novel that "abstract words such as glory, honor [and] courage were obscene"? How could he possibly look at himself in the mirror the next day, never mind looking his wife in the eye again, if he'd skadaddled? This existential hero had a choice to make, a life-defining one, and for him it meant only one thing. It's that kind of movie - meaty and meaningful. The real-time experiment is interesting in these days of TV shows like "24," and the McCarthy-era witch hunt comparisons are worth pondering, too. And let's not forget the music, either. But basically it comes down to Cooper reaching out and finding nobody there, and then doing what he has to do anyway. It's a timeless idea, and the movie is a classic
I am a very avid "Star Trek" fan, and find the DVD's very worthwhile and interesting. ( My Star Trek interests go back to the original series with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, James Doohan, et. al.
I HAVE TO AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE REVIEWER: "MKSONIC50". I READ HIS REVIEW OF "PLAY IT AGAIN SAM" THE SCENE WHERE WOODY ALLEN TRIES TO BE COOL AND COMPOSED WHEN INTRODUCED TO A LADY AND HE, INSTEAD OF SOUNDING ANYTHING LIKE ENGLISH, ONLY GROWLS. I RECENTLY FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE ALL I COULD THINK WAS OF THAT SCENE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM. I HAVE TO REPEAT THAT: "MKSONIC50" IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY. THAT WAS THE BEST COMICAL SCENE EVER.
Based on the hyper known last farewell of Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca, will emerge a fabulous, extraordinary and funny script that will allow Allen to lean on Bogart `s spirit to guide him about his personal hesitations and tribulations around the bride of his best friend. Surrealist and inventive; tantalizing and evocative that counts with an excellent cast. Do not miss it for any reason.
Joseph Campbell would be proud of this coming of age hero story. Haru (Chris Farley) is a ninja school dropout. He still maintains a positive attitude. He gets an opportunity to help a Sally, a lady in distress (Nicollette Sheridan). His mission will eventually take him to the hills of Beverly. Sensei (Soon Tek Oh) is like a father to him. Sensei realizing he can not sway Haru from his mission sends another ninja Gobei (Robin Shou) who is Haru's spiritual brother to quietly help. On this mission Haru, Gobei, and Sensei learn more about themselves.
Excellent. Delivered in a very timely manor. New condition. I could not have been more pleased
I Loved the the fact the whole family can watch it
The age of the Hollywood western had its apex in the middle of the 20th century, then with the change of modern society in the 1960's, the western genre lost its allure and Hollywood abandoned westerns for other fare. Thanks to Ted Turner and his love for American Western film making, the long lost western has been reborn in a big way. Tom Selleck continues to impress audiences as a true western hero in the tradition of John Wayne. Selleck is more than adequate for the part, big in body and big in acting skill. He takes the part of Paul Cable, and turns his character into someone we can believe, like, and respect. Cable comes back from the Civil War months before its official end. He is tired of war and killing, and wants to return home to raise cattle in his home state of Arizona. In trying to escape his wartime experiences, Cable runs into more trouble at home. He finds his wife terribly embittered by his absence, and his home farm is now run by former union soldiers who are naturally hostile to a returning Confederate soldier. Cable must not only fight to regain his farm, but he must also try to rekindle the love that has been lost in his marriage. The story by Elmore Leonard is a solid one and very believable. There are no dull or boring scenes, the picture grabs you and holds you throughout. Selleck is terrific as Paul Cable, fighting for his family, his woman, and his life. Selleck once again establishes himself as a solid western actor in the mould of John Wayne. He is every man's western hero. Selleck carries the picture on his broad shoulders with ease. He is supported with a fine ensemble cast, including Suzy Amis as his embittered gritty wife, and Haley Joel Osment (of "The Sixth Sense" fame) in a minor role as Selleck's son. Amis portrays a western pioneering woman in perhaps one of the most realistic role ever portrayed. Too many times we see western wonmen portrayed as prissy and prim, dressed in their long skirts and blouses without a scuff or mark of western sand or dirt. Amis' portrayal as Mrs. Cable breaks the mould; we see her with dirt and dust on her face, with sweat dripping in lines across her face, and with a surprising ability to hold her own with wagon reins in her hands, or for that matter, a rifle. I personally welcome this portrayal of western women, as it is undoubtedly more realistic than the western wife sitting pretty in her muti-layered petticoats. David and Keith Cariidine are fine antagonists in the fight for the family farm. Harry Carey Jr. plays a small role as Selleck's father-in-law. As a collector of fine western films, I intend to keep "Last Stand at Saber River", as it is an excellent western film in the tradition of the great Hollywood westerns; it's not an epic, but it is fine film-making and will please those craving for a fine western drama. I recommend it. James "Konedog" Koeni
This movie I consider to be akin to 'Vertigo' by Alfred Hitchcock. The pace is a little on the slow side with a lot of non-verbal action pulling the story along. It also mimics 'Rear Window' in that the main character witnesses a murder. In this case though, he was set up to be the witness. DePalma seems to have taken these themes and added some very strong satire. He slams the porn industry in some very funny ways. You will have to watch and giggle along with some of these unforgetable scenes. What I liked mostly about this movie was that it kept you guessing until the end. I don't want to give away too much here, but a clever use of 'Hollywood Hijinks' and the line 'Don't believe everything you see' fit with the story very well. 'Postcards from the edge' was the only strong movie that showed just how deceptive hollywood can be. In this film, DePalma shows how deadly and confusing it can be. As in 'Dressed to Kill', DePalma relies on non-verbal acting to carry the story, and quite successfully too. The scene begins when Craig Wasson leaves the house he is sitting to follow who he thinks he's been watching though a telescope. The scene is carried through a mall and then to a beach. I believe it's about 20 minutes. Played out well with body language and facial expressions, this scene couldn't work any other way. Like 'Vertigo', this movie seems to be drawn out somewhat. Maybe too much detail, not sure. I found myself becoming a little impatient at times for the story to continue.Not many movies attempt this slower approach, or do it in a way that makes it work. All in all, definitely a must see. Keep in mind, the action is a bit slow at times. Melanie Griffith appears here and does a great job in her role, as do the other actors. Filming, camera angels and use of props all work well. The plot is complex. This is a must see for suspense/murder mystery fans
Though cancelled for 2 years, this is the best show on TV in my opinion (even in reruns)
We have all heard about `Product Placement' especially in the James Bond films. Did you know it goes all the way back to DR. NO and was very prominent? In the scene where Bond kicks and tosses Quarrel and Puss Feller into a stack of corrugated cartons, notice that those cartons are labeled `Red Stripe.' That's right, `Red Stripe' Beer from Jamaica! In this case `Product Placement' was not a bad thing because it adds to the authenticity of this film. In fact DR. NO is one of the best films of the series. It is much closer to Ian Fleming's prose than most of the other films thanks to Sean Connery's performance, Richard Maibaum's scripting and Terence Young's direction. At the same time other elements that would be unique to the series and distinguish it from other films were introduced here. Production designer Ken Adam's sets, attractively futuristic yet totally simplistic and functional, adorned by Syd Cain's detailed Art designs set the look for the entire series making their work in DR. NO the benchmark. Peter Hunt's intuitive and effective quick-cut editing paced the film like no other at its time. Maurice Binder's brainchild opening `gun barrel' is an incredible piece of Title Design, which is equaled only by the `James Bond Theme', composed and re-orchestrated by Monty Norman and John Barry. Ted Moore's cinematography, especially the shot of bikini clad Ursula Andress emerging from the sea, is now a classic and also set a standard for future `Bond Girls.' We are introduced to the organization known as S.P.E.C.T.R.E. in DR. NO. What is unique to this film is the main villain brilliantly portrayed by Joseph Wiseman. He is unlike future main villains of the series. He isn't exactly what you may call a `social animal'. Joseph Wiseman's eerie and surreptitious portrayal made Dr. No one of the most mysterious and enigmatic of the series. In a way his portrayal seems like a model for the unseen Blofeld in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and THUNDERBALL. Rounded out by the beloved M portrayed by Bernard Lee, the lovely Miss Moneypenny played by Lois Maxwell, John Kitzmiller as Quarrel and Zena Marshall as Miss Taro, DR. NO ranks as one of the best.
This movie was more than I expected. I was astonished at the amazing graphic and effects, and especially, the robots. You are kept wondering who the true villian is until the very end. I did not expect it to be who it was. The reason why I rated this movie a four instead of a five was for the almost constant swearing from Smith. I was not prepared for it, especially since the movie is not rated PG-13 for language. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie.
"Kelly's Heroes" is an odd, yet quite enjoyable war movie. This 1970's comedic, cinematic take on WWII, mixes genres such as the suicide mission/action film, the crime/caper film and the army comedy. In other words, take a lot of "The Dirty Dozen", mix a bit of "Ocean's 11" and add in some "M*A*S*H" plus "Catch-22" and you'll have "Kelly's Heroes". The film features a battered U.S. Army infantry unit, which has been on the front lines since landing at Omaha Beach. All they have on there minds is a little RandR, that includes booze and broads. That is until Pvt. Kelly (Clint Eastwood) interrogates (with a bottle of brandy) a captured German intelligence officer, who tells him about a Nazi convoy transporting 16 million dollars worth of gold bars. Kelly hatches a plan for his unit to go thirty miles into enemy held territory and steal the gold from a small French bank, that is being vigorously guarded by three Nazi 'Tiger' tanks. I know in this day and age it might sound rather odd, but this is one war movie, that is not only suspenseful, but is also a whole lot of fun! Is it an accurate portrayle of WWII? Probably not. (I doubt there were too many hippie tank commanders during the "Big One") This 1970 release pretty much through its' hilarious, sharp script has more of a Vietnam era mentality, which satiracally makes fun of both the army and it's attitudes about war. Unlike the John Wayne style war films of the past, these guys are hardly trying to be patriotic heroes, but they are just trying to make it through the war with their a**'s intact (and maby make a little profit on the side). The film features a large, talented cast, some of whom, were already stars and others, who later went on to become big names in both television and film. This includes Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Don Rickles, Caroll O'Connor, Gavin MacLeod, Stuart Margolin, Harry Dean Stanton and Len Lesser (Uncle Leo from TV's "Seinfeld"). How can you go wrong with a cast like that? If your in the mood for a good action picture with some big laughs mixed in, then I would highly recommend Kelly's Heroes"
Its hard to imagine that a war film can leave you with a big smile at the conclusion but here is one that will! With non stop action, drama and comedy, Kellys Heroes has it all with a top notch cast and soundtrack to boot. The original script of a bank heist behind enemy lines during WW2 is a classic and is brilliantly executed at all levels. Even though the film is based on a fictional plot, it still has an authentic feel and is rated an all time classic. highly recommended
All Monty Python movies are a must-see. I think my generation has seen them all. I hope the younger generation (less than 40) watch at least one. The humor is at many levels, so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in. This just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing. Like all good humor, it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general, as well as, politics and religion (without getting nasty)
"GO" takes place in a 24 hour period on christmas eve following 3 of the main characters and events. all 3 stories intersect with each other with excellent results. sharp focus on details and time line construction make this a worthy watch! totally original, well scripted, superb performances. if you enjoy this kind of movie, check out "2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY", or "THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOUR DEAD".
my gosh mrs. bucket...bouquet has done it again... scared off the neighbors with tea and made us all spit our sides. please buy this if you have any decentce
hyacinth bucket (pronounced bouquet) charges impestuously on, in her indomitable quest for gracious living. hampered as she is, ever so slighly, by the family she occasionally attempts to ignore and often dominate, our heroine carries on in traditional british style. this set is a welcome addition to any british comedy collection. sit down, grab a lager and put your feet up to enjoy....but not on the coffee table! and use a coaster
this dvd is the best one ive ever seen snoop put out. the concert footage and sound isnt the greatest but this dvd is so much more that i thought i was getting. Dont get me wrong the concert parts are so dope to hear my fav snoop classics and i was left with one question how did they get clearance from Suge to put out his Death Row classics, but this dvd shines as a replayable classic. You would be so so suprised at what is on this, see most people are happy getting a concert dvd like the up and smoke where snoop performs in one city, you watch it after fast forwarding through all the opening acts like westside connec and you dont have to watch it again for years...this is quite a different approach. I was literally hurting from laughing so hard because this dvd gives you the bishop don juan, it gives you backstage, it gives you the norml conference...you cant even take it all in if you watched it once! i say if you like snoop, if you like weed, if you like biatches and hiznoes, you got a winner with the puff puff pass
Most of this movie is terrible, but who's complaining? The epically long "Begin the Beguine" is the climax of the movie and it makes the whole mess worthwhile. The last 11 minutes of this movie are mind-blowingly great -- absolute perfection. The sets, the cinematography, the costumes, the orchestrations and the extraordinary routine itself -- everything combines to make "Begin the Beguine" the most ravishing, glamorous black and white production number ever put on film. It's Hollywood at its apogee, the quintessence of silver screen glamor. A few of the other numbers are fun: the first, "Don't Monkey with Broadway" is clever and pleasant; later on, Fred Astaire's lovely "I've Got My Eyes on You" is also winning: a charming routine that he dances to a delightful, cheerful orchestration. Some other numbers are worth seeing, as well, but "Begin the Beguine" outshines everything else in this picture. In between the numbers, there's a lot of dreary silliness afoot. Happily, DVD technology makes it easy to skip over the dross and go straight for the gold. Eleanor Powell was a very odd actress. She was rather pretty and decidedly perky (how much you go for perky will determine how agreeable you find her personality); she was also quite feminine. Why, then, does she speak out of the side of her mouth like a gangster? She often sounds like a distaff Edward G. Robinson ("Dat was SWELL, Johnny, SWELL! Nyah!"). But man oh man, could she dance!
Right after watching this, my wife and I called our (now) 14 yo dancer in to see it. She in turn had her dance buddies watch it the next time they were over. The look of amazement on ALL of our faces as we watched some of the best there ever was worth the price of admission. Like the commercial says; DVD player; $200, DVD; $15, Watching your daughter work ten times harder on her tapping-priceless
Oh, wow. I can't complain much about this. Although some things I didn't notice explained and the ending was a little rushed, this was still very effective on me. It may've been better as a game or not, I don't know. There were several times where this made me so emotional I wanted to cry for the characters. The silent and melancholy Kaze, the hilarious and deranged Cid or the hyperactive and cheerful twins. Even for the short time you know them, they grow on you and what becomes of some of them is just extremely heartwrenching. I know some people may not be satisfied with this, but I was. I recommend it
All time classic musical/drama/love story. No matter your economic circumstances, with the right help anyone can succeed. (Just don't forget the people you left behind!
I had often heard about Degrassi: The Next Generation. I went on to the show's website often, even though I didn't get the channel it shows on. I knew as much about the show that everyone else did, and I didn't even see the show. So after a year or two of trying to figure out how to I could see the show, I heard that they were making a DVD, and I was so excited! I ordered it on ebay a few months after it came out, and it was fairly priced. I watched all of it in a day, and I was ecstatic. This show is all about what it is really like being a teen. Nothing fake, but not over-dramatic. Giving life lessons on everything, like internet relationships, the effects of using ecstasy, presssure (beer), family, rumors, first dates, and all sorts of things. Season One is especially perfect for prettens and early teenagers because it is based around a group of 7th and 8th Graders. Of course, through the Seasons, the characters face changes and more dramatic situations, but somehow, there is always a Season for teens and Preteens of every age to relate to. And that's what everybody likes about the show. This DVD also includes auditions for most cast members, which are fun to watch, bloopers and deleted scenes, which add more to the episode, and a karaoke of the theme song which is also very fun. With cast and characters biographies, you can tell that the creators of the DVDs put as much into them as possible, and it pays off.
Ronald Reagan might have gotten the nickname of the "Gipper" from this 1940 bio-pic of legendary Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, but it was veteran character actor Pat O'Brien who had the role of a lifetime in the lead. James Cagney had lobbied hard for the role, but when the actor signed a petition supporting the Republican (and anti-Catholic) government in the Spanish Civil War, Notre Dame refused to okay him for the part. This was the first of only two movies ever filmed on the campus in South Bend, and if you do know that the other one was "Rudy" you should at least have been able to guess it had to be that one. "Knute Rockne All American", which was added to the National Film Registry in 1997, is a fairly standard bio-pic, evincing the almost documentary style that was standard at the time. We see how the young Rockne (played by Johnny Sheffield, a.k.a. Boy in the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies) learned to love football, revolutionized the game with the forward pass, and coached his alma mater to glory with the Four Horsemen and George Gipp. The result is a long series of episodes from Rockne's life that have varying degrees of appeal, such as when he picks up the idea for his backfield shift from watching chorus girls dance and experiments with the idea using his wife and their dinner guests. Lots of footage of actual Notre Dame games are worked into the film, although I have no way of knowing if any of it is of the actual games being portrayed (I would be curious to know). O'Brien's performance seems a tad wooden, but if you have ever seen actual film clips of Rockne you know he is in the ballpark. A lot of the charm of this film comes from the ethos of the original Rockne, an American legend who was probably the first famous victim of an airplane crash. The result is not great, but certainly compelling (plus we all learn the correct pronunciation of his name as being Ka-Nute). Reagan's supporting role is deservedly memorable. That same year he would get to play third banana George Armstrong Custer to Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland in "The Santa Fe Trail" and would provide his best performance in "King's Row" before military service in World War II effectively derailed his acting momentum and ultimately set his life on a different path. Final Note: While there is little doubt that Rockne invented the forward pass, there is debate over one aspect of this film. In his first scene as George Gipp, Reagan is sitting around doing nothing when Rockne orders him to go in at halfback to play against the varsity and run the ball. Gipp asks "How far?" and proceeds to run it back all the way. After crossing the goal line he bounces the ball off the endzone, instead of laying it down for the "touchdown." An argument has been made that this was the first spike in the history of football. At least it is the first "recorded" spike. Did the current tradition of choreographed celebrations all stem from what Ronald Reagan did in this 1940 film? You decide if that is yet another part of the Reagan legacy that is being reconsidered this week
If no adjective appropriately suit this vivid collection of avant-garde films from the 20s and 30s, one reviewer came close in his chosen nomenclature: this one-of-a-kind-combilation, indeed, is "indespensable"! For anyone interested in or in some way connected to film and film studies this box set is a true gem as well as an overwhelming visceral experience. One dare even call it "edenic". Packed with cinematic treats - ranging from early classics as Joris Ivens' "Regen", through film historical curiosities as Marcel Duchamps' "Cinema An�mic" and Richter's "Rhytmus 21" to absolute rarities such as Kirsanoff's "M�nilmontant" - this impressive collection of short experimental films guides you through all main avant-garde genres of the 1920s and 1930s. From impressionist masterpieces ("M�nilmontant", "La glace a trois faces" [Epstein]), through dadaist art-films (Duchamps), French and German cin�ma pur/Absolut Film ("Symphonie Diagonale" [Eggeling], "Rhytmus 21" [Richter]), futuristic statements ("Ball�t mecanique" [Leger]), dazzling city symphonies ("Regen") to such seminal early sound experiments as "Romance Sentimentale" (Eisenstein and Alexandrov) and "Le tempestaire" (Epstein). While some films may, indeed, only be labled "curiosities" others are sheer strokes of genius - my personal favorites being Kirsanoff's rare impressionistic gem "M�nilmontant" (with its impressive - in every sense of the word - use of constant P.O.V.-shots, concealing the first person) and Jean Epsteins masterpiece "Le tempestaire" whose use of suspense-generating musique concr�te (or "Slow-Motion Sound", as it were) and vividly, picturesque imagery make for a unique cinematic experience. - As visceral as it is beautiful to behold. If only for its lack of a few early classics (notably, Ren� Clair's "Entr'act" [1924] and Luis Bu�uel's "Un chien andalou" [1929] and "L'�ge d'or" [1930]) this combilation of early experimental films may not be labeled "perfect". However, I am still to experience any other collection of its kind. For anyone studying film (whether by themselves or in University,) this box set may, indeed, only be ascribed the adjective "indespensible", as done also by a previous reviewer.
A must-have for all Kate Rusby fans. This beautifully-produced concert video is a pure winner, showcasing Rusby and her band at their best, before an adoring, appreciative English audience. Several things are worth pointing out: first, what a delight to see how friendly and down-to-earth she is, and what a fine performer. Authoritative, yet not stuffy or standoffish in any way, she presents these old trad ballads in a way that makes them seem like the most immediate and compelling of contemporary art... And, of course, the music is simply stunning -- the band plays sweet, but keeps things simple; it's warm and modern without muddling down in crossover pretensions, it's just simply lovely, lovely acoustic music. Finally, there's the experience of seeing Rusby sing: is it possible such a perfect sound is coming out of that everyday-looking lass before you? Guess so. Now I'll have to redouble my efforts to see her when she plays live at a venue near me... I know it'll be a night to remember
I'm a big Survivor fan; and as such, I love any of the DVD complete season packets of Survivor. It's great because if you happened to miss one of the episodes for whatever reason, you get to see the challenges and how and why the person got voted off the island. I did not however give this 5 stars, because I also own the Survivor All-Stars DVD pack, so I know that they could have done more with the Palau pack. In the All-Stars pack you get to see A LOT more speacial features of things occured on the island but never made it into the broadcast. Some of these outakes give a lot of insite into camp life and the characters, which is always fun. But other than missing those features, the Survivor Palau pack is well worth seeing
Revenge, it's said, is a meal best served cold. The creepy, existential, ultra-violent OLDBOY (Tartan) takes that dish and smashes it in your face with raging. Without explanation, Oh Dae-Su, a businessman with a family, is kidnapped and imprisoned in a dank, dirty room for 15 years. Suddenly he's released, given money, a cell phone and nice clothes. On his way to revenge, he discovers his kidnapper still has plans for him, and it's something worse than what's already happened. Now he's got five days to find him and balance the books. Rated R. Genre: Asian Noir/Thriller. 2 Hours. Actors: Min-sik Choi, Ji-tae Yu, Hye-jeong Kang, Dae-han Ji, Dal-su Oh. Director: Chan-wook Par
I have been using Callanetics off and on since the 80s. I was so excited to see that it came out in DVD format and wasn't discouraged to read that it didn't have chaptering - Callan always has recommended doing the full workout anyway. But, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this DVD now has chaptering. So, please don't let that discourage you from trying this awesome exercise program! You will see truly amazing results in a short amount of time. I have used it only 3x so far this go around and I already feel stronger and have better posture. Have fun
This movie is really good for the pre-teen who is struggling to make the right choices. I thought this movie was great! Im hearing that now girls as young as 8 are having oral sex because they want to be popular/cool and I like this movie because it shows the consequences of doing the wrong thing just to be popular. Every young girl needs to see this one
I have been an Adult Swim viewer since Space Ghost CTC's early days. The Venture Brothers is probably my favorite of them all (The Brak Show was a riot also). I am in my 40's and so I can relate to all the jokes on the stuff I grew up on (Marvel, DC, Johnny Quest, Scooby Doo, etc). The formula started with SGCTC taking mundane kids 60's-70's shows and tossing them in adult situations filled with lots of sexual references (many homosexual), uber violence for violence's sake, profanity (beeped out but you know what they are saying), well you get my drift (think excrement jokes). It's Ted Turner in his old coot liberal ways taking everything that was semi American of good vs. bad in cartoons, and screwing it all to hell. But despite the same formula over and over (SGCTC, Harvey Birdman AAL, The Brak Show, Robot Chicken, Aqua Team Hunger Force, Sealab 2021, and probably some others I missed), I still watch and laugh, with The Venture Brothers being the best of them all. One thing that I really laugh about is that the teens and gen X'ers watching have little or no reference for where these jokes are coming from, they are just laughing at the situations and don't get the parody. I tried to tell a co-worker (whose 25 years old) about a Robot Chicken bit about Hogan's Heroes and he never heard of that show! I'm glad The Venture Brothers has got a strong audience, so thanks you young ignorant types for watching! I'm in baby boomer delight!
I love this movie. Great sequel, great characters, great gore. A must for all fans of the "Saw" movies.
the dvd set is a good one, who cares if its edited, your still getting a good first season of roseanne. and you get commentary and behind the scenes stuff as well.if your not a fan dont buy it. and if you are a fan and you are tired of waiting for it to come on television, than definitely buy it
Known to all, this is the story of Dorothy Gale and her journey to the magical land of Oz. She meets a Scarecrow who needs a brain, a Tin Man who wants a heart, and a cowardly lion who desperately needs courage. The most popular film of all time , seen by over a billion people. It's timelessness is proof enough of its value . Certainly flawed when scrutinized and written about for 56 years, but still most beloved. In 1998 rereleased on the big screen: magic. And admittedly the most important film of my life: As a child I was obsessed with the film and only a little less now
The Movie with the 20,000-mile or one-million-laugh guarantee ! Crank your Engines ! With a roar , sputter and pop , drivers wheel westward in wacky turn-of-the century autos for a New York-to-Paris race . Ahead 20.000 miles , a barroom brawl , a sinking iceberg 2.357 pies in the face and incalculable laughts . Blake Edwards (1922- ) turns a marvelous cast loose on a round-the-world higway booby-trapped by some of the funniest screen gags ever . Jack Lemmon (1925-2001) and Peter Falk (1927- ) are nasty Professor Fate and his dim henchman Max . Tony Curtis (1925- ) is their good-guy nemsis , the Great Leslie and Nathalie Wood (1938-1981) is cheroot-puffing suffragatte reporter Maggie DuBois . Zestily scored by Henry Mancini (1924-1994) and ravishing in a New digital transfer with revitalized digital audio from restored elements , The Great Race is great fun ! . As i mention Super transfer and Recommended highly !
Lemon and Curtis are a great team - "Some Like It Hot" and "The Great Race." In this movie we have great melodrama and the ageless story of boy meets girl (Natalie Wood) and she catches him. The star-studded cast is enhanced by the superb acting of Peter Falk in one of his great comic roles, the hapless Maximillian always catching the short end of the stick by his perpetually out-of-sorts boss, the permanently crabby Professor Fate (Lemon). Curtis does what he does best - looks dashing and debonoir in a role so familiar to him he could phone it in. This DVD is a collector and one of my all-time top ten favorites
Waiting was a pleasant surprise. It's certainly filled with crude humor, but it manages to be funny anyhow. My first job was in a restaurant much like Shenaniganz and perhaps that's why I found the movie so worth watching. The game the employees play is over the top, but a lot of the rest of the stuff portrayed goes on. If you're a rude anus of a customer, don't think for a second that the wait staff and cooks won't mess with your food - they will. It pays to be polite and tip well, especially if you are a regular. Chi McBride's character as the dishwasher who also dispenses free psychological advice was great, and I thought Luis Guzman did a great job as Raddimus. All in all, based on personal experience, the movie wasn't that far off of what really does happen behind the scenes in a typical Golden Corral or Ryan's Steak House. Sure, the characters are over the top, but they are based on people just like some I've known. If you're offended by frontal male and female nudity or crass sex jokes you won't want to see this movie
This film burns the screen with power, sensitivity, unbreakable bonds and emotional connections that will blow your mind. Jolie and Burress shine in Foxfire in a way that you'll never forget. Every woman has been a girl, and, even if they store their feelings deep inside, they have to wish they had spent a few months like these girls. I know I do. But even guys have to relate to the realistic rebellious and connected spirit these girls reflect on-screen. Every character is well-developed. I wish I could change the ending of the movie, but that ending is what keeps things real. This movie is definitely a treasure
Foxfire is an excellent movie that demonstrates the friendship of 5 girls who learn how to stand up for themselves in this world. The inspiration for their newfound rebellion is from the 5th girl that brings the 4 others together, Legs, played phenomenally by Angelina Jolie. I must say this: I really don't care much for Ms. Jolie, and perhaps the media is to blame by making stories like her and Billy Bob and their whole blood thing the top news story, more recently her husband-stealing with Brad Pitt, but I cast aside those feelings for an hour and 40 minutes and found myself absolutely loving her performance. If you are like me and don't like her, please do give her a chance in this film. She's astonishingly good and I kept having to remind myself it was Angelina. As a matter of fact, the entire cast turns in memorable performances. I think this is a great movie for women to watch but I don't know if men will enjoy it quite as much. I did see one male reviewer claiming he didn't find it to be just a chick flick, but he might be the minority. Guy or gal, if the story sounds intriguing to you, and it really is, then Foxfire is definitely worth checking out. I give it only 4 stars simply because the character of Maddy (wonderfully played by Hedy Burress) has a boyfriend but she nevers breaks up with him and he kind of fizzles into the background. Left me wondering why he was even in the movie to begin with, but that's my only criticism. At this price, it's a fabulous addition to your collection, though believe it or not, the low price right here on Amazon has been beaten by Wal-Mart...it's in the $5.50 bin. This is a great movie that reminds us that sometimes people will make it difficult for you to do the right thing, but you must believe in yourself and stand for what you believe. Definitely recommended
Probably the best place to start for Bergman initiates. Three decent films (although I think "Through A Glass" is in a different class to the other two features). Moreover, they all form a useful overview of the progression of Bergman's art from circa 1960 to circa '62; from the religious torment of 1961's "Winter light", through the conjunction of interpersonal conflict and religious neurosis of "Through A Glass..." to the explicit focus on familial relationships of "The Silence", (the latter reminiscent of Bergman's mid-to-late 60's output). In short, although there is nothing to match the astounding "Persona" (1966), the films do give a great indication as to Bergman's filmmaking in particular and the whole boom in Euroean Art House cinema of the early 1960s in general. DVD: Excellent Criterion transfers. The documentary disc a Swedish film about the production of "Winter Light") is excellent as well, worth watching alone for Bergman's casual conversations on his religious torment: he speaks of spiritual angst in the tone most people speak of going to the shops for a loaf of bread
Paris , The city of Light , Shines even brighter when Audrey Hepburn (1929-1993) and Fred Astaire (1899-1987) team up for the only time and bring their luminous starpower to this exquisite musical featuring songs by George (1898-1937) and Ira (1896-1983) Gerschwin .This dazzling romp -Filmed on Location in Paris where you could go back in time and see Paris year 1956 , wonderful made on Tour Eifel ,Sacre Ceur , Notre Dame , Louvre and many other known tourist places ! .

Super High Quality transfer
Soldier of Orange with commentary by Director Paul Verhoeven is a must-see for all history buffs, WWII historians and lovers of war movies. Based on the life of Erik Haselhoff Roelfzema, it chronicles his life in the resistance and that of a small group of law students in Leiden, The Netherlands. Verhoeven's commentary is worth the price of the DVD as he explains scene by scene what he tried to portray, while asking some very thought provoking questions. Verhoeven and I are the same age, and both of us lived in Holland during the occupation. His view of the conditions in Holland and the responses of the Dutch under occupation are very different. I also think his references to Das England Spiel are inaccurate. Having said all that, I still consider the DVD one of my most favorite productions, including the film itself. Soldaat van Oranje is my choice for best ever Dutch film. Those interested in learning more about the real Eric Hazelhoff Roelfzema should read "Soldaat van Oranje Omnibus" which includes "De Verre Tamboer (The Distant Drummer)" and "Op Jacht naar het Leven (In pursuit of Life)" all by Eric Hazelhoff Roelfzema
Yet another amazing film from Paul Verhoeven with so much depth and weight I can't even tell you. Stays with you a long time after the film is over which many of his films have a tendency to do. Jeroen Krabbe gives an excellent performance as does Rutger Hauer in the leading role. Everything in this film is top notch particularly if you are in any way a fan of war films. So many great scenes (i.e. Alex and Eric's tango towards the end, andquot;april fools dayandquot;, vengeance on a bicycle, the beach scene and many many more.) See this as soon as possible. It would make a terrific double feature with the Young Lions
This is a wonderful collection of horror pictures made by MGM and Warner Brothers during the Thirties. Neither studio was noted for horror pictures, but the ones they did make are unforgettable to fans of the genre as well as late night movie addicts. Following is a synopsis of the films contained in the collection: THE MASK OF FU MANCHU (MGM, 1932) - Boris Karloff is wonderfully creepy as Sax Rohmer's evil genius, Dr. Fu Manchu. It would not be the last time Karloff played a Chinese, as he later starred as Mr. Wong in Monogram's low budget detective series later in the decade. The plot concerns a race between good guy Lewis Stone and Fu Manchu to find the tomb of Ghengis Khan. If Fu Manchu gets there first he will possess the magical relics placed there which, in turn, will allow him to enslave the world. Look for a young Myrna Loy in a delightful turn as Fu's diabolical, and scantily-clad, daughter. DOCTOR X (WB, 1932) - A good early effort by Michael Curtiz concerning the "Moon Killer" murders in which the victims are strangled, cannibalized and surgically dissected under the light of the full moon. Wise-cracking reporter Lee Tracy traces the clues to a spooky seaside mansion, where Dr. Xavier (Lionel Atwill) and his colleagues are conducting strange experiments. Made in early two-strip Technicolor, the film is wonderfully atmospheric, and the sets themselves will linger in your mind. Aside from the irritating Lee Tracy as reporter Lee Taylor, the acting is crisp and to the point. Atwill in particular is eerie. Fay Wray is good as Xavier's daughter. I won't give any more of the plot away, but just remember the phrase "synthetic flash." Once heard, it will linger in the mind always. MARK OF THE VAMPIRE (MGM, 1935) - Tod Browning's remake of his "London After Midnight" with Bela Lugosi as the vampire, Count Mora, and Lionel Atwill as Inspector Newman. In the original, both roles were played by Lon Chaney. The plot concerns the death of Sir Karell Borotyn, who appears to have been killed by vampire Count Mora. Fearing that the vampire's next victim will be Borotyn's daughter, Irena (Elizabeth Allan), vampire expert Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore) is called I to protect her and shed some light on the goings-on. Look for Carroll Borland as the Count's daughter (a role played by Edna Tichenor in the original). MAD LOVE (MGM, 1935) - One of the great plots in horror film history, and one that has been repeated many times. Colin Clive plays the brilliant concert pianist Stephen Orlac, whose hands are crushed in a train accident. His wife, Yvonne, is a noted stage actress whose ardent admirer is Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre). Although she rejected Gogol previously, she is forced to seek his help in restoring her husband's hands. Gogol replaces Orlac's hands with those of executed knife thrower Rollo, and the fun begins. Clive is his usual tortured, neurotic self and Lorre is brilliant as the oily monomaniacal Gogol. Pauline Keal, in her book on Citizen Kane, stated that Welles copied Lorre's look for the older Kane. THE DEVIL DOLL (MGM, 1936) - Tod Browning's last great film is about as respected Parisian banker (Lionel Barrymore), who is framed for robbery and murder and sent to Devil's Island. Years later he escapes in the company of a scientist who has discovered a way to shrink living things to one-sixth their original size. Barrymore finds a new use for the scientist's discovery as a means of revenge on those who had framed him. THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X (WB, 1939) - The famous Humphrey Bogart punishment picture! After years of complaining about his one-dimensional gangster roles, it was said that Jack Warner decided to teach Bogie a lesson and put him in the role of a vampiric lab assistant who needs freshly drained blood in order to stay alive. Bogart is a hoot in pasty-faced white makeup and a grey streak through his hair. Wayne Morris play the wise-cracking reporter who exposes Bogie as the killer. (Tough job considering the makeup). Look for Olin Howard (Jensen the drunk in Them! and the Blob's first victim) as the undertaker. This film has never before been released on either VHS or DVD, so it is a welcome find for horror fans and Bogart fans as well
In my opinion; there have not been enough roles that tap into the unique genius of Martin Short's humor with the exception of, "Clifford". My then teen children and I spilt our sides laughing at Short's work when we first saw this film! Several times we laughed so hard at a scene; we couldn't go on until we replayed the scene several times over. We were all in tears with uncontrolable laughter! All three of us still concider this movie to be among our most favored. Even if you are not a big fan of Martin Short; you will enjoy, "Clifford"
I was so disappointed they cancelled this series. I was hoping that the SciFi channel would pick it up. Hope you science finction lovers got this one because it's GREAT
It is movie about the strength of friendship and how three men carry out a promise to a dying friend.How men will fight to the end for a dream of one man.The characters drew strength from one another.It tells about the hardships of the old west.The unfortunate greed of men and how greed can kill.Tom Selleck's character showed the the ability to love a woman and his love of his friends.The other characters complimented each other.The movie was well worth the price.You will want more of the same
Regarding the above title, there was very little difference between the 2 versions on this edition of the Dvd. There seems little point in the censors deleting the scenes as they did in the USA and the UK as they do very little to the film's context. Still, it's a very good horror film anyways with plenty of gore (if that's what you're into) and I'd still give it a 9 1/2 out of 10
TCM III was a good movie.It had all the necessary tools and villians to make a good horror movie.It lacked the essential characters,though.It would've done better if they had brought Chop Top or Drayton back to life.The film is about two friends headed down to Florida from Texas when they come upon a pit of decayed bodies.We already know it was Leatherface,and the two drive on.The next day,they come upon a gas station,where a crazy,yet funny gas station attendant named Alfredo work.Also making his appearance here as well is Viggo Mortenson as Tex,a redneck cowboy who gives the two friends guidance.The two take the road he suggests after a near attack and end up stranded in the woods,pursued by the evr vigialnt Leatherface armed with his trusty chainsaw.It gets the job done every time.As in the Texas Chainsaw tradition,they are captured and prepared for dinner.One of the friends narrowly escapes and must take on Leatherface with the help of an Veteran they met along the way.It's an overall good movie and I loved it
My 2 and 3 year old boys really enjoyed this DVD. This Backyardigans DVD is their favorite so far (they have the 2 others Snow Fort and It's Great to be a Ghost also). The music is lively but not loud and obnoxious like some kid's videos. It introduces kids to different styles of music and has great characters whose behaviors you don't mind your children copying. The Backyardigans are one of my favorite shows for them to watch.
Love it...love them all. Disagree about the pace of this one. Heart of the Jungle is great even though it is slower and you have to own this one just to get the Tea Party show. It is a must have. Even if it is just for Polka Palace which is great unto itself.
I cannot recall a time when I did not love this hilarious movie, which is my favourite from the 1980's by far. The superb Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in "Big Business",that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from Hollywood's Golden Age. A total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely doesn't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory. The premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in "Big Business", it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble Jupitor Hollow to the height of New York's business world. The story begins in a flash back when wealthy New Yorkers Hunt and Binky Shelton are passing through rural backwater Jupitor Hollow when Binky goes into labour. At the same time locals Garth and Iona Ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of Sadie and Rose but are also mixed up. We move forward forty years to where Sadie Shelton is the corporate head of Moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of Holomade, the local industry in Jupitor Hollow. Getting wind of their plans the militant Jupitor Hollow resident Rose Ratliff decides to go fight these "Pinstriped Trouser Snakes", on their own territory and Sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring Jupitor Hollow. Through a mix up they end up staying in the Plaza Hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as "sinks in the living room", and "soaps in the shapes of swans"! Complication piles on top of complication as Sadie Shelton's ex husband Michael (Barry Primus), can't believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural Sadie for his hard nosed wife and Jay Marshall(Michael Gross), can't for the life of him understand why Rose (Ratliff) is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure Rose (Shelton). All comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two Sadie's are really the city Sheltons while the two Rose's are really the twins meant to be in Jupitor Hollow. The fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when Sadie (Shelton), is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to Sadie (Ratliff), to put all her watching of her idol Alexis Carrington in "Dynasty", to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing Jupitor Hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully. Classic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins, on the classic 1960's comedy series "The Patty Duke Show". I dont think I've ever seen Bette Midler in finer form than in "Big Business". Her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails Sadie Shelton who's all "hostile takeovers" to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin Sadie Ratliff who only wants to be able to say "keep the change!" is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter. Her classic mirror sequence with her "twin", is a total riot and her statement that "this whole thing has got UFO written all over it!",will have you breaking up with laughter. Equally Lily Tomlin as both country activist Rose Ratcliff, "I'm gonna go kick some snooty New York Ass!", and as Rose Shelton the awkward out of place city girl "I hate shopping and I hate New York in June!",is also top rate. Her rejection of Jay's engagement ring as a supposed "bribe" and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a "great big belly scraping pile of cow plop!", is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene I never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening I have of this movie. Of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at New York's Plaza Hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up. Two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk's (Joe Grifasi), continual mixing up of Sadie Shelton/Ratliff which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined, and especially Fabio Alberici's (Michele Placido), total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with - one minute they are corporate killers, the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone! The hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women (one from the country and the other from the city), seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff. It is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first. Classics like: "Im gonna dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease!","Oh my God it's so COSMOpolitan", "Oh sure its full of crowds, smog, sex fiends, and white slavers, it's a pistol, I've got about as much use for it (New York), as a Toad has for spit pearls!", "Computer chips, they've got their ways!", and "Have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase?", are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script. Total escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more. It is a real pity that "Big Business", so far has marked the only time that Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle. This film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages. I've been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as I am! So I'd say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you haven't already. You wont regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends, in Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in "Big Business". Enjoy!
While Elmo going to the doctor is a good part in the video, that is not the only good thing about this one. It features several shorts with cartoons and different characters. My favorite part of the video (and my daughter's) is the part featuring Ernie and Bert. Ernie decides he is going to be a doctor, and needs Bert's help so he can practice doing the things doctors do. Bert just wants to know if he is healthy, and after putting him through several tests, Ernie says that he doesn't know if Bert is healthy or not because he isn't a doctor-but he just needs 23 years of school before he can tell him if he is healthy or not! The cartoons are funny, and there is a never before seen Elmo's World at the end all about doctors, too. Very cute

Sometimes, when you're in an overly silly mood, only one thing will do: Pauly Shore. That's why I love Bio-Dome. It's just silly all over. The concept is utterly ridiculous...2 stoner community college kids mistake an enclosed environment, the bio-dome, for a mall and get trapped inside for a year. If you enjoy Pauly Shore in all his silly glory, you'll have a lot of fun with Bio-Dome. Don't take it too seriously...just watch and laugh. For those who enjoyed Encino Man and Son-in-Law, Bio-Dome will do the trick. An amusing way to spend an hour and a half.
Masterful pretty much says it all. I agree with the reveiwers who rated it "one of the best all time movies"---not just among westerns. This film is Wayne's HIGH NOON. The hard edges play well with today's viewers and the things we confront. You will travel with the Duke as he is consumed by hate. He's not out to save the young lady, but to destroy her. What will happen when he is face to face with her? Watch and enjoy a great film! If you are looking for a new western I highly recomemend "Broken Trail!
An exercise in self-aggrandizement, but done so well it's forgivable. Set in London circa 1910, Chaplin plays an aging music hall comedian who once made audiences laugh but is now over the hill. One day as he stumbles home drunk, he smells gas, and rescues a young girl (Claire Bloom) from a suicide attempt. He nurses her back to health and sees to it that she resumes her dancing career. Between being philosophical about life and keeping his own career afloat, Chaplin performs a couple of old routines from the past, including a great sketch with Buster Keaton in which he plays the fiddle and Keaton the piano (it was both their swan songs). The movie is autobiographical and reeks of self-importance, with a number of references to Chaplin's carrer in pictures alluded to. But there's intelligence, too, and not a little sentimentality (what Chaplin picture doesn't contain this?), but Chaplin is such a demanding master that there isn't a moment of sloughing off or cheapness. Chaplin did everything, from writing the script to composing the music, and all of it is touched with genius. Made in 1952, the movie, amazingly, was not seen in Hollywood until 1972.
Many shows have their moments, but this is the first show I've ever laughed OUT LOUD, multiple times in one episode. The humor is so creative and edgy and amazingly timed. I will say that you do need to be around my age (I'm 40) to get alot of the inside jokes, but if you do their hilarious. And if you don't there's still plenty to make you laugh. I would HIGHLY recommend all three Volumes that are out now
(Just as a note, that's the Japanese title) There's something about this movie that I've always liked. I'm not sure what it is, but being a Pokemon fan, of course I like it. The movie have always been great, and this one has something that I really like about it. The movie starts out in the North Pole, with a scientist named Dr. Lund, his friend Yuko, and his son, Tory. There is suddenly an explosion, and Tory is trampled by a frightened pack of Walrein. And, as they say, after that, all heck broke looks. A meteor is the reason for the explosion, and the creature inside the meteor is more than your average Pokemon. Deoxys, a rare Pokemon from another planet (woah, more than one Poke-Planet? Niiice.) The strange creature, carrying a rock with a gem inside, is suddenly attacked by the large, dragon-esque Rayquaza, a frequenter of the Ozone Layer. So, what the heck is he here for? Ah, So Rayquaza feels threatened by Deoxys, and so, both pokemon break out in a rather spectacular pokemon battle. (With some pretty cool background music, might I add.) So, professor Lund flees with his colleages, and son. Four years later, a young Pokemon trainer named Ash Ketchum, along with some friends, enter the high tech city of La Rousse, and as fate would have it, Tory's hometown. And, well, I won't spoil it from there. The plot is good, and Deoxys' 'destructive' intentions are less cruel than one would think. Don't worry, folks, no angsty Mewtwo-copy here. Also, Rayquaza brings some nice battles into the movie. His fights against Deoxys are totally awesome. The soundtrack is also great. I really love the music played during The opening scenes of the movie, and the fights between Rayquaza and Deoxys. The animation is very spiffy, shiny bright and new :P. I haven't had the pleasure of watching the original Japanese version of the movie, but when I do, I'll tell you all about it, 'kay? Well, I guess that pretty much wraps things up. Oh yes, Tory's afraid of pokemon, due to the whole 'get attacked by a herd of walrein' thing. Heh. Okay then, Sayanora, faithful readers!
I did not have many expectations when this came out as a movie but was pleasantly surprised! The dvd was a must own as soon as it came out
Wrath Of The Dragon. INTRODUCTION: The Dragon Ball Z series is one of the finest animes out there, as any fan of Japanese animation will tell you. The series has a "love it or hate it" reputation, but those fans who get into the series are totally immersed by it for a number of reasons. Young people love the series for the fast-paced action and adventure, while older fans enjoy it for the sheer number of characters, and the way they are developed and evolve over the course of time. It's no wonder the series is considered Akira Toriyama's magnum opus, and by far the best of the three Dragon Ball series. When Toei animation made Dragon Ball into an anime, they didn't copy Toriyama's mangas verbatim. They added in many sagas and plot elements not in the manga, often as a result so that the manga and anime were released at the same pace. Toei even created movies based on the series! There were thirteen movies, two television specials, and one OVA/OAV. While not usually canon to the storyline, they are an undeniable part of the Dragon Ball Z franchise that can't be ignored. OVERVIEW: This is the thirteenth of the thirteen Dragon Ball Z movies. THE STORY: Majin Buu is beaten. Our heroes have won. Peace has returned. Yeah, right. Just as everyone has settled down, Gohan and Videl rescue an old suicidal man, and help him to unlock the seal on a music box of his using the Dragon Balls. What they don't know is that this old man is from a race of warlocks who once unleashed a great evil upon the universe. The Z Fighters must join forces with a warrior who came from within the music box to fight against this unspeakable evil that once terrorized the universe. But are they strong enough? REVIEW OF STORY: This is one of my favorite Dragon Ball Z movies, due in no small part to the unique storyline, and some battle scenes that are absolutely spectacular. Granted, I wish Vegeta had a larger role, but no big complaints there. There is no other part of the Dragon Ball Z series that has a storyline anything like this. The interaction between Trunks and Tapion is excellent as well. And the ending? Let's just say it stands on a plane all its own. You won't want to miss it. OFFICIAL? This is a rare example of a Dragon Ball Z movie that could have taken place in the actual series storyline. Right after the defeat of Buu, this would fit into the actual series continuity. It didn't exist in the original manga so I consider it unofficial, but you be the judge. REVIEW OF DVD: All of FUNimation's Dragon Ball Z DVDs are pretty much the same as far as content goes. There is no bonus content, unless you consider the obligatory trailers on the DVD to be bonus material. And honestly, I could have lived without them. Some more recent DVDs have character profiles, though these are lacking and could have been written better. Why couldn't get get interviews with cast and crew, or trivia/facts, something like that? FUNimation has a lot of room to improve on the DVDs. THE DUBBED VERSION: Lots of people tend to bash FUNimation's dub of the Dragon Ball Z series? Why? It's inaccurate and sometimes just plain stupid. They can do good dubbed versions for plenty of other animes, such as Full Metal Alchemist, but every time they've tried dubbing Toriyama's classic, they butcher it to hell. The nu metal they put in as background music only further defiles the original series. Stick with the uncut subbed track. OVERALL: Get it. Dragon Ball Z movies don't get any better than this. EDITION NOTES: It was released in edited and uncut versions. Do I even have to say it? Get uncut. And watch the subtitled Japanese version.
I really liked this DVD...has a lot of information and covered a lot of their important games. The special features are interesting, as well
I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The sex scenes were some of the best I've seen because they were graphic yet very realistic. The story was touching and honest. If you're an adult who enjoys a realistic story that is very hot, you will definitely enjoy this gem. Watch and enjoy
I am a huge Chef! fan. I have been watching the show since it was on BBC America and my local PBS station. I was excited to find that the "Complete Collection" was finally available on DVD. I got the package and could not wait to start watching the show and that is when the dissappointment sat in. I realized that shows were missing from the "Complete Collection" like: Divorice?, Gareth's Father and the Christmas Special "A Bird in the hand". Can someone please tell me how this can be the "Complete Collection" with those episodes ommitted from the DVD?
I thought this was an excellent, excellent film. I saw it for the first time last night, and I was struck by how well it was acted and filmed. (It was directed by Jean Renoir, so it has his skill as a baseline recommendation, but it was exceptionally good.) In response to those who protest that it gives an unrealistic view of war and ignores its horrors, I would admit that perhaps some of the conditions were idealized (the prison rooms looked like slightly-dingy hotel rooms, and the treatment of the prisoners.)However, one should realize how different World War One was from World War Two or other more recent wars. WWI had a few decent reasons for being fought, but primarily it was about European countries seeking to defend their national pride and expand their territorial holdings. As seen in this film and "All Quiet on the Western Front", (and the poetry of e.e. cummings) many soldiers got into combat and realized that they were not that different than the men on the other side of the trenches. They fought for the ideals of their respective countries, but separated from the propaganda, your enemy could be your neighbor. In WWII, there was an obvious evil (genocide) to fight against that needed to be defeated, but WWI had mostly stereotypes to lend menace. "Grand Illusion", like "The Rules of the Game" reflects the decline of the great aristocratic families of Europe that was occuring during and after WWI. Ancient families that had controled dynasties for centuries were left without the power they had held. The world moved on and left them in anachronism, a reality which Von Rauffenstein and Boieldieu foresee. Much of the film is focused on the universality of the human condition. It doesn't deny the differences between people, but it shows how the connections between people can transcend some of these barriers when faced with the reality of war
A few comments about why I didn't like the video for my daughter - The DVD is cheaply done. The animation is almost all old and there are frequent times when the princess look like an animated statue with only their mouths moving, while their prince next to them really does look like a statue since he doesn't move at all. - The Christmas themes are simply not well done with the video containing things that were more suited for Halloween than Christmas. The part where Belle almost drowns (and would have certainly died of hypothermia) is a good example of this, though not the only example. Overall the video is not at all suited for young children
HORRIBLE NOT FUNNY I HAVE NO IDEA HOW PEOPLE CAN SAY THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE ok now i personally, am a adam sandler fan, but i just hated this movie. Accually, i hated it so much, i couldnt even finish it and we had to give it away. i recomend you do not waist your time with this horrible excuse for a movie.
I actually had this on my shelf for 2 or 3 years. I tried to watch it a time or 2 and just could not get past the first 10 or 15 minutes. I was finally in the mood to watch it the other night. Let me say I am a big fan of Ashley Judd and I have loved every movie I have seen her in. She did a great job, as always, just poor script writing. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered, such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms, etc. This fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point? I may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something I missed...
This movie is a disappointment considering it was made at a time when so many of the survivors were still alive and recently freed from Russian captivity. The film covers the experiences of a veteran German officer assigned as an advisor to a Rumanian Army Corps on the eve of the Stalingrad encirclement. The film does not go into any kind of depth either in terms of character development or story line to explain the importance and tragedy of Stalingrad. One must think that it even disappointed it's original German viewers of the 1950's who probably desired some kind of explanation for the disaster of Stalingrad and the Nazi era. As an anti-war film this film is a failure; as a shoot 'em up action war film it is droll. All in all this is less satisfying than a made for TV movie of the same period.
These 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in Chinese Cinema and definetly for Jet li and Movie Kung fu. However, I watched 10 minutes of te first movie on this compilation which DOESN'T have english Subs ( I don't mind, but every other DVD I have ever seen has this ) Also, in the first ten minutes, there have been 2 incredibly bad awkward translations. For some reason, Cousin Yi is now Aunt 13 and Chu's bird is now Chu's Beard. This is Crap. Do NOT buy this, buy the movies seperately, you can probably find them each for 9 bucks, and they would be more satisfying that way
A girl-buddy movie starring Shelley Long and Bette Midler as two women in love with the same guy. When they learn that he's "used" both of them, they turn from being mortal enemies to closest friends as they chase the louse from New York to New Mexico. Silly and dumb, with the usual chase fare thrown in. Everything is a cliche, from the opposing personality idea (Long is an orderly goody-twoshoes, Midler a loudmouthed mess) to desert hippies to car chases, etc, etc. The movie seems to go on endlessly
Between the not so below average acting of Thomas and Biel, the film might have benefited more from a better script, but it did not. There was nothing in this movie that they could have done better, it was just a fluff holiday movie that a family would most likely not want to watch that much
This movie makes me want to vomit. Watching Bio-Dome is physically painful to the overwhelming majority of people
This movie would have been a complete failure if Fred Astaire hadn't starred in it. I found it to be exceptionally dull. Except for "I Lost My Hat in Haiti" and "You Are", and footage from the actual wedding of a member of the British monarchy, this film is pretty terrible
Trash film usurps title. People that like this film seem to come from a group that have only seen ersatz films such as the new Mummy have nothing of real movie value to compare them to. This must also be a group that has never seen a live play or an old German film. The filmmakers attempted to capture a cross between Nosferatu. It may have worked in 1920 however the film is to clear and sharp. It comes off looking more like a cross between a cartoon and a graphics ad. The actors outweighed the characters and looked like they were reading the script. I could swear that some were watching the teleprompter. And who's idea was it to cut up a three day old corps to get covered in blood that if was any, had lone ago coagulated? I could go on with quite a few examples. But you get the idea. This should be helpful even if you liked the movie. If you are driving by a place that rents this DVD, stay in the car!
Why oh why do they keep placing redneck Tim Allen in Christmas movies? He can't act and he is disgusting. I am ashamed at Jamie Lee Curtis for reducing herself to this garbage. I can understand Tim Allen thinking this was a good script, the producer probably mailed the script to him as a coloring book with pictures...but I had higher expectations from Jamie Lee Curtis. I have to say I usually love her. But she was awful in this film. She is reduced to whining and crying. She does little else besides agreeing to everything her caveman husband tells her. Tim Allen was awful from day one in his redneck Middle America sitcom, and to this day retains that disgusting, overweight, burping middle America character. Why do they keep putting him in Christmas films? It really does nauseate me to no ends to see him playing Santa Claus.
Many people will consider giving this movie such a low rating a sacrilege.This is understandable because so many people have grown up watching this film.I too loved this movie at a certain period of my life.The period between my birth and when I turned ten.That was when I read the book.The book is perhaps one of the greatest literary works ever created.It has now been awhile since I first read it,but I still remember the excitement I felt with each new chapter.I finished it in a few short hours.Since then,I have reread it several times,and each time it has been just as enjoyable.It is a true classic that people of all ages can enjoy.My brother reads as little as possible, but even he loved it.The movie,on the other hand,has gotten worse with each subsequent viewing.It deters from the book in almost every way possible.It makes a mockery of each character through a combination of poor writing and horrible acting.Judy Garland is an absolutely abominable choice to play the plucky heroine,Dorothy Gale.In the book,Dorothy was a little girl of about eight or nine and she was brave and clever.In the film,she is whiny,cowardly,fretful,and slightly stupid.She is also portrayed as being around fifteen.Making her this old distorts the book and her older age doesn't fit with her childish behaviour and appearance.Besides wrecking the book,this movie when looked at clearly is a terrible film.Don't misunderstand me,I am a fan of musicals.However,this film made for an atrocious musical.Practically every single song was ANNOYING!!!!!Also,the "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" number did not suit the plotline as it was in the book.This brings me to the BIGGEST,MOST AWFUL,distortion of them ALL!!!In the book,Dorothy really went to OZ!!!!!Not only that,she returned to Oz several times in other OZ books.Eventually,she even moved there to live!!!In making the whole experience a dream,the entire story of OZ was destroyed.Having said that,this movie receives a 1 in my opinion.Even so,I realize that many people will persist in liking this movie despite my words of wisdom.If they do sill consider this movie a favorite after reading the book,then the 3-Disc DVD is the edition to purchase.The features look good and the picture is restored.As for me,I will spend my money on better things.
Not as much tap dancing as the other ones. You probaly have to be Irish to understand the theme because I didn't
I never saw the series on tv so when it came out on dvd, I was excited, remembering the magazine from when I was a kid and being a fan of ILC, SNL, and comedy itself. I am also known for finding various comic styles funny where others don't. I write this review now as I am TRYING to watch the third disc. I got the dvd the first day it came out and I have to watch every dvd I get, even if I saw it before. Regardless to say, I only broke a smurk ONCE throughout the first 2 1/2 discs. I even tried watching parts of the disc when I was having a great day and even when I was not in the greatest of moods. I was in a good mood again this morning so I started watching it. I think it is the lamest show that I have ever seen. I really don't know why it ever lasted past the first season. If you've seen the show on tv and you like it, more power to you, if you haven't seen it, don't buy it, it is a waste of money. Everybody says that after season two is when it gets funny... I personaly don't think I should have to endure a whole first season for it to get funny
This is the type of yoga that gives yoga a bad name. I will not even give this one to a student or friend; put it in the Goodwill bag
Or you out of your mind! I watched about 5 mins. and I'm speachless. That was the worse movie I ever andquot;startedandquot; to watch and couldn't get to the controls fast enough to turn it off. Throw them away, please
it starts out as a lady comes home to cook a boy for dinner but the boy tells the lady three storys from the Tales From The Darkside book. the first one is Lot 249 with Christian Slater, Julianne Moore and Steve Buscemi, which this one is the best with of course Slater's character. then the next one is The Cat From Hell with William Hickey and David Johanssen, this one is ok but it sometimes shallows the movie with its annoying and mangling old people. the last one is A Lover's Vow with James Remar and Rae Dawn Chong, it starts off good with Remar but then ends up being a cheesy story with its lame gargoyle effects
don't buy this junk,it is nothing more than trailers for 50 movies that the makers have deamed as the "worst". like another review said just look up a list somewere!!
I love bad movies, so when i saw there was a documentary out all about ranking the worst movies i thought i'd give it a try. Don't bother with this DVD. Its 60 minutes long. Now think about that fact. 50 movies, in 60 minutes. Some movies are barely shown for twenty seconds or they use a commercial that reveals little of whats bad in the movie. SO problem number one they don't show enough of the movies. Problem 2 is the bad designs of people booing and throwing popcorn at every movie they talk about. The voice over was also a bit on the annoying side but thats probably the fault of the people who made this. Its actually very ironic that this being about the worst films is actually a terrible film in itself. Another complaint i have is on what merrits on they ranking these films. FOr a few, it seemed they put their not cause they were the worst movies made but because they were box office flops. I'm not saying Ishtar or Howard the duck were good movies but they shouldn't be placed on a list of the worst. There are alot more terrible films, with acting thats unbelievably bad, mistakes galore, poor lighting, poor directing, poor writing,etc. These were just bad movies that were flops. I'm surprised they didn't throw Heaven's gate in here if they were doing flops. So i don't get the criteria they were using. A lot of really terrible movies were excluded too for some reason. Manos is sadly missing. Glen or Glenda is alot worse then Plan 9(despite plan 9 having the fame) yet plan 9 got a lower ranking. I guess the best thing i can say about this DVD is that they did get a list of some very bad movies. Robot Monster and Santa Claus Conquers the Martians are amongst the worst movies you'll ever see. According to the DVD, only Black Belt Jones is a movie so bad its funny but many (If not all) picked are so bad they are funny. I didn't like how they included the movie Troll only because the sequel Troll 2 was so much worse(For heaven's sake, Troll 2 didn't even have trolls in it. it had Goblins. Thats bad!). So, if you guys want to Watch a List of movies with barely any clips of the films that emphasize there baddness, this a film for you. those of you who don't, heres a breif list of some of their movies. Snow WHite and the 3 stooges Greetings The frozen Dead They saved Hitler's brain Black belt Jones TNT Jackson The thing with two heads Howard the Duck Billy the kid vs. Dracula Bela Legosi meets a brooklyn Gorilla Strange Creatures Bloodsucking freaks Leonard pt. 6 Attack of the crab monsters Robot Monster Santa Claus Conquers the martians Troll Trog Xanadu The Crippled Masters I married a Monster from outer space Teenage Zombie Ghost and the invisible Bikini Fat Spy Plan 9 from outer space Glen or Glenda Bride of the monster The mesa of Lost women Voodoo Woman Ishtar Frankenstein Conquers the world The Creeping Terror The great Alligator Hillbillys in a haunted House The incredible melting man Firebird 2015Ad Dracula Vs. Frankenstein Smokey and the Bandits Pt 3 The wild woman of Wongo The ape Galaxy of terror The RObot vs. The Aztec Mummy Snow WHite (German Version) Creature from the HAunted sea The swinging CHeerleaders Trial of billy Jack Killers from space Spider baby The 3 stooges in orbit The sorceress The crawling hand JD's Revenge Frankenstein meets the space monster Killer shrews Great white The thing with two heads Eegah! The incridebly Strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed up zombies. Certainly far from a definitive list of Worst movie
I found this film accidentially on Amazon and was curious because I know Welles didn't complete a great deal of films. His directorial flourishes are definitely evident, but it is hard to really enjoy the film do to the quality of the transfer. The picture is dark and the audio is exceptionally bad. It looks like there were some budgetary issues in the making of the film so I couldn't tell whether this was a bad DVD presentation of a mediocre film, or an awful movie put on DVD badly. I did not shell out of the Criterion edition, which might give a better glimpse into the qualities of the film
This is a potentially very good film. Interesting idea (bearing some resemblance to "Angel heart"). Sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer. I don't think I've ever bought (DVD or video) or seen (TV or cinema) quite such an awful copy of a movie. It is clearly stuck together from more than one original, with the logo "Delta" appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner, but don't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version. The term "special edition" seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released !!!!! Tony Curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue (clearly from some late night cheap TV series). Don't buy it. Maybe there's a better version (I read talk of a "Critereon" disc), maybe not. Still, it really isn't worth (any) money
I bought Orson Welles Citizen Kane and liked it so I decided to watch other Welles movies. I bought Mr. Arkadin because the DVD is cheap and rated high on IMDB. I should have buyed Touch of Evil instead. The quality of the picture is laughable, sometimes there are glitches in the sound during scene changes. Judging by the picture and sound quality I would say that they used equipment from the 30's to shoot and edit the movie and that the print used for that transfer was stored in a refrigerator during 45 years. Welles directing work is good but obviously he had to deal with the poor quality of the European movie industry of the 50's. Sometimes the picture shake, during the opening credits the captions are white on a white or gray background so we can't read everything. The editing is very poor, there are too many scene changes. When I bought this DVD I expected to receive the LaserLight version, instead I got a DVD made by Alpha Video. The case cover is different and there is no supplemental material. He was mastered cheaply on a PC with the SpruceUp DVD Maestro software, that seem to create problems, each time I try to play the disc on my computer the FBI warning message appear and then the disc eject. I didn't notice any audio syncing problems however. This movie is the perfect candidate for a remake. I give **** for the story and * for the overall quality of the movie
The Weight of Water (Kathryn Bigelow, 2000) This movie should have been a big production-- an adaptation of an Anita Shreve novel directed by Near Dark's Kathryn Bigelow, starring a handful of big-name actors. So why does it seem like a Lifetime Original Movie(TM) on steroids? Jean Janes (Shadow of the Vampire's Catherine McCormack) is obsessed with a pair of murders that occurred on the Isles of Shoals in 1873, when Louis Wagner (Rome's Ciaran Hinds) was convicted of the murders of two women and executed. Jean isn't sure they got the right person. She and her poet husband Thomas (Sean Penn) set off for the islands on a boat with Thomas' brother Rich (Josh Lucas, recently of Poseidon) and Rich's new girlfriend Adaline (Elizabeth Hurley, who went from this right on to film Bedazzled). The interpersonal relationships on the boat cause tensions to flare, as everyone seems to want pretty much everyone else, and the situation on the boat brings Jean to a possible revelation of an alternative theory of the crime. It's an interesting premise, and from everything I've heard it's carried off quite successfully in the book, which I haven't read. But oh, it doesn't work well at all in the film. The links between the two stories are shown only by the way the two stories are intercut; no work at all was done on trying to parallel the two in any structural way. Most of the actors are wasted here; even the vastly talented McCormack seems only a shadow of her usual irrepressible self, while Sarah Polley, whose story takes place over in the nineteenth century time frame, seems as if she's worn down by a lot more than inimical primitive island life. About the only actor who's really effective here is Hinds, who plays his role to the hilt. It's not the worst movie I've seen in the past month, but it's pretty close. *
I bought a copy of NTR for one reason and one reason only: a single scene near the beginning, prominently featuring Rosanna Arquette. This was the same reason I bought a copy of andquot;The Wrong Manandquot;, starring John Lithgow and - Rosanna Arquette. Discretion prevents my explaining further. Other than the scene already mentioned, I found the movie pretty worthless
The story is ok, but the acting is a bit off and the movie drags to much... but if your looking for some raunchy sex there is a non-simulated oral sex scene in it
Added - 5 whole minutes - Documentary about how to make a great movie suck by making it a Broadway production. Deleted - Karaoke version of five songs from the soundtrack: Hold Me Now, Do You Really Want to Hurt Me, Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic, Rappers Delight, White Wedding Worth the extra $13 - I think not I suppose if you are one of the four people on the planet that doesn't own this classic there is a option of which edition to purchase, for the rest of us, it's just not worth it.
Well, nice cinematography as set-designer work: nicely interiors and well dressed actors. Maybe, visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once, but not enough to consider it as a remarkable movie of year, as other reviewers trying to assure
I was so bored by this film that I thought I might be missing some subtle French cultural context or emotional triggers that would make it interesting. I asked a younger, French, female friend, who said she found it at least as boring as I did. The characters didn't engage my sympathy. Nothing explained why these people were even remotely interested in each other, so I didn't care what happened to them. Scenes like long car drives from the marriage bed to a first infidelity didn't build any dramatic tension or advance a plot or provide any interesting insight into the characters themselves. The sex scenes were banal and the bondage episodes in particular laughable. I sat through to the end, thinking there might perhaps be some breathtaking ending to redeem the wasted minutes. I want my money back. Plus damages
as I remember when i watched the original chinese version, although it wasnt any big deal but I did like it as I remember, but this version is totally destroy that feeling, something about the translation is just bad to the core makes the movie like a piece of crap, especially some sound effect. Why don't they put the original track in it I hard can understand. if u can find some asian version and rewatch it u would agree with me. it worth my 3 stars with the original trac
It didn't take me long to forget this film. Once again it stars Jet in a strange role
Not a good copy of this great movie. I'd wait and buy the andquot;Restored Authorized Edition.andquot; Even though I bought this version, I've ordered the other. That's how much I like Metropolis is general
THE BAD I can't say I dislike this item, but I did not like it either. Even though I'm still a novice golfer (score between 95-105) and been playing for about 18 months, I've read a lot of golf fundamentals articles and studied like 4 other DVDs ...(yes I'm an instruction junky) and I can say that this instrutor (Simon Holmes) misses to point out many important fundamental factors that influence a good swing, and even though I like how the DVD has a well structured lesson category listing, he does not explain deeply enough on many things. The filming production seems to have a good intention for this DVD, but it lacks camera closeups/slowmotions on the ball, clubhead, ball lies and graphical enhancements for better understanding of what he want's to explain. I mean with today's technology on DVD production, this seems to be a cheap one. THE GOOD He has very good tips on many subjects that I think they're transparent for a very beginner. If this is not your first instructional DVD, and just want to gather a new bunch of tips, then buy it. Otherwise a better selection that I can reccomend for a complete golf school DVD, is the Wally Armstrong's Ultimate Golfing Experience. The set is very cheap because it's a compilation of old '80s and 90'videos from that instructor, and from the 5 DVD's in the box, you can thrash 2 if you like, but for $17 bucks...HEY!! is worth it! I hope this helps and saves you some money
Unlike many, I hadn't seen this film when it first came out. So it was with much anticipation that I recently sat down to watch it. Well, it stunk. What a disappointment. The only really good thing in there is Leo McKern, who shines forth like a beacon in a fog of wooden acting and stilted dialogue. Show 'em how it's done, Leo. Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful to look at, but her role is limited. Matthew Broderick is clearly inexperienced this early in his career, and delivers his lines without any panache whatsoever, which hampers the film, since his character is supposed to be a quick-witted thief. Fortunately, he has come a long way as an actor since then. Rutger Hauer is just plain bad. In defense of the director and crew, the film is prettily shot (with the exception of the poorly choreographed climactic fight scene) in well lit, scenic locations. Otherwise, I would not recommend this film to anyone with expectations.
Vol. 3 marks a new low for Family Guy: A season that started out strong but ended very "OH my god, I was so shocked by that hahahahaha". It seems to be riding on it's laurels, so to speak, and it's almost as if we are supposed to find the characters acting differently funny. I don't like it, and I think it's been reduced to recent Simpson quality. Meanwhile, the DVD has a few commentaries (I'd like to point out that the competition Simpson DVD's have commentaries on every episode, same with Futurama...)Some sub-par special features. The biggest problem here is that the first two discs are single-layer, which means four episodes per disc, as opposed to the traditional seven. We only get thirteen episodes of crap, and maybe we should be grateful, but all in all, whatever. Raoul Duke
I'll get this out of the way: I never liked the 80's slasher films. Stuff like the Halloween series, Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th just never entertained me all that much. The idea of slow walking killers going after Olympic sprinters and still get caught felt really ridiculous to me. Of course the major draw was the death scenes: elaborate moments of viciousness. Flinging Jason into the future is of course going to elicit unintentional laughing but it's a good kind of laughing for some reason. Jason is in the future in a facility on a planet, except he escapes(of course). Disposing of scientists, including The Fly and Scanners director David Cronenberg, he ends up getting cryogenically frozen, along with another scientist. Flash forward 400 years and a ship discovers them and founds out, ooh, a nice reward for Jason. As usual he comes to life and does what he does best: kill attractive looking hotties. You don't go to these movies to expect well-written dialogue, character depth or anything, you come for the kills and to tell you the truth, they're slightly disappointing. Besides one kill, which answers the question of what happens when a frozen face hits a hard surface, the kills are kind of been there/done that. It's basically stab here, impale there, it seems kind of unimaginative. A few even happen off screen with the yelling off in the distance. Characters are just there to be taken care of brutally and some are. However, Jason does what I'm starting to hate is kill off the very cute girls. One girl, wearing a top with a belly showing gets disposed off(off screen) and I'm like "damn guy, let one cute girl live for once!". Dialogue is of course stupid but there were some funny lines. A self-deprecating parody about the sex teens have in the film is referenced. "We love premarital sex!" is so classic, as well as "it's okay, he just wanted his machete back!". Granted they won't make an AFI list but they made me laugh. It's the kind of movie that you probably weren't supposed to like: it was ridiculous and dumb but boy did it seem fun. Just wish it was better
Jennifer Love Hewitt needs to fire her manager. I've yet to see her in a truly good role. Those terrible Know What You Did Last Summer movies, Garfield, Heartbreakers, If Only, and many others weren't exactly memorable roles. The Truth About Love doesn't help bump her in that direction either. Not that I was expecting Oscar-quality when I looked at the back of the box, seeing a picture of her in a leather corset, I wasn't going off of words to know that I was slightly interested in the movie. I've owned it for a few months now, and only recently got around to seeing it if only because my girlfriend watched it in the other room while my friend and I were in the other room playing games. She kept coming out every 5 minutes, and I could tell that she wasn't that interested. After giving in and watching it with her, I now wish we had all played Resident Evil 4 instead. After what has to be one of the most annoying "sweet" introductions, we learn that a man has mailed a valentine letter to his friend's wife, Alice, supposedly by accident. Yeah, real smooth. When Alice gets it, she assumes it's from her husband, Sam, and sends him a hot letter as well. He gets it, thinking it's from another woman, and the problems ensue. He starts to hide the letter from her, and with that in mind, she tests his loyalty to her. She texts his phone anonymously with some of the dirtiest things Hewitt's done in recent memory. But as it turns out, Sam does have a mistress, and things get more complicated. You know what? The entire movie's boring up until 3/4 through. You're better off just reading the back of the box for the plot summary, then skipping to scene 9 or 10. And that's one of the cons I had with The Truth About Love- the time it takes to build up to what's an actually good conclusion with Sam's Anonymous admirer doesn't seem like it's worth it at first. But I'll admit, Alice's plan to bust Sam was a good one, though she gets a harsh slap of reality once everything's over. The key problem with the movie is probably that it takes place in England, and Jennifer Love Hewitt's forced to take on one of the worst accents I've ever heard. There were a few times when I thought that they hired a voice actor to dub over her lines- it doesn't sound like her, and mouth movements often don't match lines. And that's funny considering the majority of the cast is from the UK. Then comes the unbelievable part about a guy cheating on a woman of Jennifer Love Hewitt's stature. There's no way in hell that could ever happen unless the guy is mentally challenged (ie- Carson Daly). The kicker is that Sam's mistress is a woman who looks to be in her 40s, and pales to Hewitt in any physical category. And how about that Archie guy? He's in 3 important scenes at most. All the other times we see him involve he and Sam's court room scenes which I have to say, are some of the most boring attempts at forced humor. In fact, the trial doesn't even have a connection to the central plot aside from showing that Sam and Archie are friends and partners. Alice's friend is also a complete hussy, and seems like she didn't make the cut of being on Sex and the City. Finally, guys, I'm sorry to tell you this, but there are no scenes of nudity here aside from when Alice visits an adult movie store. Though the best we get from Hewitt is her in a corset, it's only for a few collective seconds. The love scene is kind of laughable too when she's wearing that ridiculous wig. Even right now, I still have mixed feelings about the movie. Just when something completely stupid happens, something decent does right after it. This is some of the worst picture quality I've seen in a while. The transfer looks terrible. Even watching it on my HD Monitor, there were tons of errors. Grain, artifacts, and something new. I almost want to call it rippling- many scenes are out of alignment, and we get a watery effect that takes over the entire picture. I can't explain it in full detail, but more or less, people's faces and bodies would look all twisted every couple of seconds. It stays for most of the first fifth of the movie, then is only occasional after that. But then there's blocking and many more problems that make up for it. You'd think with a direct to dvd release, they could at least get something right. The audio fares a little better, but everything's weird once again. While you can hear the audio just fine, it's almost too loud at times, and incredibly, all the actors' lines look like they're dubbed- especially Jennifer's. This becomes very obvious halfway through the movie when Archie yells at Sam. The camera is behind Archie so we can see the back of his head talking to Sam, but when he yells, his mouth doesn't open. Special features? None. Though the box tries to claim that a chapter selection, previews, spanish subtitles, close captioning and Dolby 5.1 are special features, we all know better than to fall for that. At the very least I expected some behind the scenes interviews or something with everyone going on about how great it was to work on a movie bound for failure. Is there any reason to buy The Truth About Love? Not at all. I guess that phrase "low expectations lead to better results" does ring true for it. I just wish the director, writers and actors had put a little more effort into everything. But you know the funny thing? I'll bet twenty bucks that this thing gets remade in a year or two with A-list actors (sorry Jennifer), and finds success after they rewrite all the boring parts. Even as a date movie, there are many better ones out there. Might I suggest Shaun of the Dead
When buying a product, you expect a little bang for your buck. Unlike its counterpart Family Classics, Action Classics leaves far short of its mark. Although these movies are old, you expect quality. Unfortunately, the sound is barely audible and the movies grainy. You'd think that because they're on DVD, the quality would be better. The movies shown are low budget (B movies)with unknown actors and limited action. Need I continue ?? INACTION in this case would be best served. Save your money for better things... Like a hot fudge sundae !!!
This dvd is pretty bad. I've seen the online trailer for the kino dvd release and the picture quality on the streaming quicktime movie was better then the picture quality on the "triple feature" dvd
Heavyweights was a quite a disappointment, considering the presence of Ben Stiller. The movie sheds light on a popular summer camp for fat children that unexpectedly finds itself under different management. The new administration will make it clear very soon that some major changes are to take place... The plot and the acting are surprisingly (!) average, while the humor and the dialogues are below average. Ben Stiller's character, a cross between Zoolander and Dodgeball (both being AMAZING movies), was unexpectedly plain and bland. As for the rest of the cast, this film does not seem to be their thing. Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really... No masterpiece here.
The script and dialogue are lousy. All this film has to recommend it is a pretty face and occasional scenes depicting flesh. The lady is not very interesting to say the least. Nothing original. This is a cookie-cutter clone of a thousand other French movies about young women trying sex for the first time. Avoid.
I do not like the format of the DVD at all. I had taken several Pilates classes before buying this DVD, but I found it difficult to remember exactly what to do in each pose since all of the instruction is at the end. Much of Pilates is in the finer points like breathing correctly and making sure to squeeze at the right times, so with no reminder of what I should be doing in each pose I felt like I was being cheated out of a workout. I don't think that having no interruption is worth sacrificing form, so this DVD will be stored away while I learn the specifics of Pilates elsewhere
A friend and I tried watching this film once again recently, but still we both find it irritating and unpleasant. From the beginning, when Katharine Hepburn's character destroys other people's cars without a care, we found one scene after another tedious and unfunny. The acting is fine, as could be expected from such greats as Hepburn and Cary Grant. But the characters are not sympathetic, fun or interesting. Grant's character is an unassertive, spineless person who is easily dominated. Hepburn's character is blindly selfish. Who could care what happens to them? The one interesting element is the acting that is done in proximity to a live leopard.
Let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE MADtv fan and have been for years. It is easily my favorite show of all time. While I loved "The Complete Season 1" released in 2004, I think this DVD set is terrible. Why they abandoned complete season releases in favor of throwing together a random mix of sketches in no set order from the 3 most recent, and arguably the worst, seasons makes no sense to me. Of course this does have some classic sketches, impressions and characters on it, such as Debra Wilson's Oprah and Mo Collins' Lorraine, but a majority of it is just random. Most of these sketches aren't some of the better ones. Who picked this list? Of course I'll still buy it because I love MADtv, but hopefully in time they'll go back to releasing complete seasons again. I can watch a better mix of sketches and episodes for free every day on Comedy Central
I really enjoyed Season 1 but from the look of this we're never going to see other complete seasons released. Why release the best of Seasons 8, 9, and 10 when you've never released the complete seasons? What about complete seasons 2,3,4, etc. Cabana Chat with Rodney Dangerfield? Phil Lamarr's impressions of Michael Jackson, Prince? Little Hassan Taylor's Greatest Hits? Darlene McBride? Vancome Halloween? The "Wash me" video parody of Alanis Morissette? "Lick my baby back behind" video parody of Britney Spears? The "Love muffin" video parody of Mariah Carey? The Bush Cheney rap video parody. The UBS man goes to the video rental shop, etc.? Afropuffs cereal? The early MadTV was a little savage at times but that's what made it funny. I feel it's appropriate to issue the best after you've put out the complete seasons. Of course maybe there were legal problems. Some of the humor was pretty savage! I guess if you can find it in syndication then make your own.

this is a movie directed and played by a guy with unsalvageable narcissus complex. always dreamed himself as a modern day casanova in n.y., just like that george kastansa character in 'seifield', a big lover, a womanizer, a baldy forever young romeo. almost all of the screenplays he wrote, the movies he directed, the characters he played were all like this. i just don't know how women would fall for him in the least sense and possibility, only if in his wet dreams. this is a very nauseating movie. all of his movies are almost the same, only the movie titles changed. the only one i liked is his recent 'match point', nothing else. and i felt lucky this guy was too old to play that role now, otherwise, he wouldn't allow anyone else to play that ambitious murderer but him.
I expected so much more, because it's Marshall, but regardless of where you purchase this, IT'S EDITED. It's pathetic. This is Eminem! I understand you have a daughter Mr. Mathers, but DO NOT MAKE ALL OF US WATCH AN EDITED CONCERT. This is probably the MOST ridiculous thing I've ever bought. There's not even a warning that it's censored. You just buy it, pop it in your DVD player, and listen to a concert with mostly EVERY OTHER WORD jarbled up. It's a useless DVD. There's NO POINT in buying it. First Encore, now this. I've been a fan since the earlier parts of the 90's. As somebody from Michigan, I saw him before he was Mr. Cartier global super star buying skin treatments at Barneys. I've never been more disappointed with an artist.
I went and saw another film as I was so disenchanted with this one. The opening had so little to do with the rest of the film I thought I was watching a preview to another film. I don't care for spoofs about Catholics and protestants. The Pythons can't sing or dance (for those on this board who claim their talents are innumerable). I say to the fans of Python: get a life
Unfortunately they just do not get off the ground. Python is known for being wired provocative and in many cases cutting edge. Regrettably they missed the mark on this one. One or two skits may strike your fancy but you have to wade through the rest to get to it. However if you like sex, violence, blood, and debauchery, could care less the fact that they have nothing to do with the absent plot, you could find this film interesting.
Not my type of humor. I think I'm just too old to find the sophomoric comedy entertaining
I'm sorry folks, but I went into this one with high hopes given the outstanding reviews from both critics and laymen. It would be a tremendous understatement to say I was disappointed. This film is horrible in nearly every respect, but this is the film's fatal flaw: A "character study" is no good when the characters act in a manner which is counter intuitive and against the grain of human nature. The film portrays two convicts on death row as likeable guys who are willing to help out with this ridiculous standoff because they have no other choice. Sorry to bring up the obvious here, but the ONLY thing any person would care about in that situation is escaping. He would not be pre-occupied with helping defend the police station (he would have immediately shot the cop upon being given a gun); he would not be worried about "his chances out there" (remember he's on death row); he would be concerned only with escaping IMMEDIATELY. Sorry to all you fans of this "cult classic", but a movie in this vein must be at least SOMEWHAT realistic to gain my praise. This one is a mess.
This DVD has a very bad image and sound. Altought it is a good movie, I don't recomend it if you are looking for a Charles Bronson movie for your collection due to its bad reproduction. No menu, no subtitles, no chapter selection. I wished I did not buy it
The Gauntlet may rank as one of Clint Eastwood's worst movies. It is so unrealistic and silly I frankly didn't want to even finish it. Released in 1977 after a string of some really good westerns and Dirty Harry movies, it stands out as being a real stinker. Here Eastwood plays a loser of a cop, Ben Shockley, who is sent on an assignment to pick up a witness in Las Vegas for a trial. He's told it's a "nothing witness for a nothing case" so he thinks it'll be an easy assignment. Well, poor Shockley finds out differently when not only the bad guys but the good guys are trying to kill him and his witness. It seems some conspiracy is afoot. The rest of the movie is Shockley, and his female witness, Gus Mally, running from cops and mobsters trying to kill them in increasingly ridiculous bad action scenes. And plot is so ludicrously predictable it's pretty clear early on just who the bad guy behind the curtain is. Unless you really, really like Clint Eastwood, this is one to forget. I'll bet he wishes he could.
What a rip off! This is my very first bad experience with Amazon. Heck, this is the first time I haven't been extremely satisfied. Who in the world would purposely order a PSP disc of ANY movie?????? The heading for this item still incorrectly states that it is a two (2) disc set. It does not mention that it is in some stange format no one in their right mind would buy. You can imagine my surprise when I opened the case and found what looked like some kind of strange contraceptive device. Don't order this
I had to contact Amazon five times about this item. I ordered it on 10-1 and it didn't ship for several weeks. Then when I check my account, the description had changed to UMD for PSP. You will not get the DVD if you order this. I eventually cancelled mine. Amazon is using the wrong cover art and the wrong disc specs for this title and doesn't seem too worried about correcting this. DO NOT ORDER
I am extremely dissappointed with amazon on this one. This is not the dvd version of the film. However, on all the links to it, it says "DVD". When I received the item in the mail, amazon was very ambiguous in helping me with my return, and even told me that they would send the DVD version of the film. Nonetheless, two days later, I received the same PSP version again. Great movie, it's in my top ten. Amazon screwed up on this one
I was thrilled when I saw there was a new Sesame Street Christmas DVD out as my 3 and 6 year olds have the other three memorized. And, as much as I enjoy being a Sesame Street Kid (37, just like the show), I was tiring of the same stuff over and over. Imagine my surprise, then, when virtually all of this DVD is just the highlights of the others (Classic Ernie, Bert and the beloved Mr. Hooper from _Christmas Eve_, Hanukkah from _Happy Holidays_, and Bob singing "All though the Year" from _Elmo Saves Christmas" among others). The only new part is Christmas future and it is a poor cartoon instead of new muppet footage. If you don't have the other three DVDs this would probably earn 4 stars. If you do have the other DVDs this is not a necessity. Hopefully next time the budget will allow Sesame Workshop to be more creative
I can't imagine why Madonna, Janet Jackson, or Michael Jackson's VMA performances were not included in this DVD. The most influential artists in videos and performance were excluded. I don't understand. It is a travesty. I hope MTV releases more of the VMA performances with Madonna, Janet, and Michael. I'll buy this one in hopes they will release a really great complilation of VMA performances
I have to say, this show did not turn me on at all. I like twisted humor and a good puppet show. This, however, didn't do much of anything. In fact, it aimed at the gutter and worked it's way down. Very disappointing. And also very low-budget. Looks like something filmed for public-access TV. I'm guessing Canadian Public-Access TV. Some people might find it funny. I understand some people find BeavisandButthead funny. I don't
Both sides of Disc 5 are unplayable. All others are O
Starring Tony Perkins perfectly miscast as a major league ballplayer. What can you say? The Red Sox have Jimmy Pirsall, Tony Perkins and "Fear Strikes OUT". The Yankees have Lou Gehrig, Gary Cooper and "Pride of the Yankees".
I just had to write a review about this movie seeing that it is being made into a Hollywood film (The Departed). I can defintely see why someone wanted to remake this movie. After watching this movie I turned to my wife and said, "This movie would have been great if it would have stared someone/anyone with an ounce of talent!" The acting is very affected and self-conscious... understand that's how Hong Kong mega-stars always act (its a sort of US 1930's throwback style). I really, really despise US film remakes - but Martin must have seen the same potential so many others saw in the intriguing storyline. I would suggest watching the US version first and coming back to the original afterward so that you do not ruin the surprises - not to mention this movie is avoidable without the new-found intrigue. PS I have not yet seen The Departed, but I am assuming that it is a much better version than this. HOWEVER... come on America, we have plenty of creative writers out there, can't we just throw them a bone rather than using old scripts and plots
I love TNG, DS9, and I even quite like a few of the characters in Enterprise. But I HATE Voyager. Why? One simple reason - Janeway. I cant stand her. She makes me want to puke. She has only two personas in the entire 7-year series and she constantly alternates between them, and they are both nauseating. First, vomit-inducing Compassion-face in which she puts on this phony 'caring' face and talks in a 'caring' gentle whisper. Two, tough-chick-face in which she puts on a hard-chick scowl and speaks in a deeper hard-chick voice that is not in the slightest bit believable. God she nauseates me. The same thing happened with Maggie Thatcher. The one time the dumbasses put a woman at the helm and she totally ruins everything. Unlike Kirk, Picard, Sisko and even Archer, Janeway has no charisma at all. Yuck. But shes not the only one, this has got to be the only Star Trek series in which no matter how hard I tried I could never develop any attachment to the characters. They're all boring. Only Paris has any appeal and even then not much. I watched the first 3 seasons hoping I would grow to like this garbage and finally gave up. Years later I finally came back and decided to give the final season a try in the hope that the characters might have developed over the years. No. The same old nauseating Janeway, same old boring episodes, spewing over with self-righteousness and endless lectures about human 'morality'. And this series is the most mushy, sentimental crap of all the Star Trek series. There is barely an episode that is not cringe-inducing in its emotional mushyness. The only moments in the entire seventh series that were worth watching was the 'Q2' episode and that was only because Q was in it (and they even turned that into a morality play), and the very end of 'Renaissance Man' when the Doctor tells Harry that his saxophone playing sounded like a wounded Targ. Good riddance Voyager, and especially good riddance Janeway
The book of Acts is a book of power! Sadly, this is what is lacking in the DVD presentation. The minute I began watching I knew it was going to be a weak (acting) rendition of the story. Thankfully, it is word for word from the Bible, which is why I gave it two stars. Reading through the book of Acts one can almost feel the electricity of the Holy Spirit working in and through the lives of the Apostles and believers. All of that is lost in the DVD presentation. I would not recommend this DVD. Stick to the Book instead
The only other FF material I've see is the movie and I didn't play any of the games yet so I'm not basing this review on that. After watching the first 3 dvdsand about 1/2 through the show i can say for me this show sucked. The animation was bland and ugly looking. The C.G animation which was produced by GONZO was poor and didn't blend in at all. (If you want good works by GONZO check out Full Metal Panic, Vandread, Hellsing, Gatekeepers and a few others). The plot was seemed to aimed at kids under 12. 2 kids and an adult woman get on a train in an abandoned train station that leads them to a different world. There they meet a strange man(strong silent type). Each episode goes something like this. The kids and woman get off the magic train at a strange place. The bad guy(kid??) sends his minions to where they 3 are. The man in black shows up(approx 7 min left in ep) and does nothing until the kids are in real danger then a light on his gun(attached to arm)turns on and he says "IT HAS MOVED??" yells "SOIL IS MY POWER" (cue in 2 minute transformation sequence where he puts 3 different colored shells in it and shoots ) a creature pops out of the smoke and defeats the bad guy, then he goes away. The kids and woman then get back on train and the show is over. That happens every single episode and there is very little plot development. Come on at least Pokemon has more of a plot. This show is clearly aimed for kids 10 and younger which from what I understand is not a big "Final Fantasy" demographic. Strongly recommend a rental to see if you like it.
If you're a stoked surfer looking for a thrill, this is andquot;NOTandquot; the video for you. However, if you want a training video on big wave surfing, go ahead. A better video for the stoke would be the classic Endless summer 2. Much more of a better buy. Billabong goes out of their way with a whole lot of explainations in Odyssey about tow-in surfing, training on watercrafts, and then they get to the surfing. I fell asleep throughout the 2/3 of it. I had to skip through half of it to get to the surfing. Nice documentary for Discovery Channel, not for the wired surf enthusiast. So
i can't even begin to tell how bad this movie is. it just rolls around in its own excess and asked us to play stupid and just follow along. i sold this one the day after i bought it
This is your typical film which replaces reality with fantasy. Something liberals like to impose on others. It flopped because it just doesn't have the ring of reality to it. You can have beautiful scenery, some decent actors (except the Ford-Lincoln-Mercury twit with his quasi-permanent ICE CUBE scowl) and then a really stupid storyline, whallah, you get the fantasy liberal worldview. In the movie the evil guys are an ex-militia leader and his band of neo-feudal toughs. The good guys are "just-wanna-livers" with their leader being a conman who found his destiny. LOL! Dumb, just plain dumb! You realize it is the neo-liberals (no, I'm not pro neo-con either for the record, neo-cons are worse, getting others to do their fighting - cowards they are) who put limits on free speech, have eroded things so bad that I'm afraid a General Bethlehem type guy (minus the lunatic traits obviously) is the only way to fix things. Look to ancient Rome for the answers on this matter. To be brief, the "bad" guys are liberals and neo-cons and the good guys are yet to make themselves known. This movie is right only in that America will split up and probably fall in some capacity. History shows the way, which our current bio-mass masquerading as humans will not understand nor can do anything about it (too busy playing video games and IM each other). One lesson to be learned in the movie is this: might makes right. Here's another: all is fair in love and war.
ROYAL WEDDING isn't on DVD yet. That's because the OWNER of the film, Warner Bros. hasn't released it yet. But several other companies have, under the "guise" of public domain. The original copyright on the film was not renewed properly with the Library of Congress, so the film is perceived to be public domain, although the music is very much copyrighted and every distributor of this movie is participating in copyright infringement by selling these "bootlegs". The companies make the money, because they're selling OTHER people's property. The people who ultimately suffer are YOU, THE CONSUMER, unknowingly buying products of inferior (worse than professional VHS) quality, thinking you're getting the real thing, because it's a DVD. Save your money. Wait until Warner Bros. gives us the real thing thing... And by the way, the movie gets 4 stars, it's the cheapo bootleg DVD that gets 1 star!
Every store should have a DVD shredder for movies that suck. Rental stores should offer refund upon return of this movie and immediately throw it away. Adding Darryl Hannah and Denise Richards to an already horrible story line just to sell DVDs is a disgrace. Trying to do 80's style cinematography to add artistry and color just made this movie suck more. Maybe the book version tells a different story if there is one. Save your time, money and eyesight by avoiding this storyless video.
Flat lighting, cheap sets and costumes, dull dialog, wooden acting, and a goofy plot; even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this movie. Zero stars should be an option. For more inspired soft porn, check out the work of Andrew Blake (andrewblake.com)
I have to agree with most of the other reviews. This movie not great art but to me it is great comedy and strangely compelling. I have found myself watching it over and over again. I would rate the film as five-stars. Unfortunately, I can not buy the DVD because the cheapskates at Warner have only released this in butchered full-screen format. As such, I can only rate this DVD as two-stars and certainly no stars for Warner
Our family has an embarassingly large collection of Elmo and Sesame Street DVDs, so I speak from experience... I found this production to be way below par. My 2 1/2 year old son picked it out at the video store and we got through maybe :10 minutes before he volunteered to turn it off and do Play-Doh instead. The plot if poorly contrived, the production value is low, the acting for the most part is awful, and it's basically just a way to stitch together a series of music videos which at his age, my son has no interest in. He did like the part where the muppets try to break open the dressing room with a jack hammer. But I'm not buying the video for a 12 second clip. Better bets: A Celebration of Me, Grover or Sesame Street: The Street We Live On
I just rented this video for my 14 month old daughter. I was disappointed with the 4 dollars I spent on it for that. It is more like a music video than a story. The segments are of adults, no children singing or playing and the story line isn't much. Sure my daughter swayed along with the music but there wasn't anything educational about this video and I am so glad I didn't buy it. I really limited my daughters exposure to tv and this was the first video we ever left her watch and now I'm sorry that we did even that. Stick with the sesame street tv program or prescreen other dvds before you buy. I hope this helps you from being as disappointed as we were.
All the promos made me think that this would be a really great Sci-Fi story with beautiful babes all over the place. Well, there WERE some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies, never materialized. Has the art of "posing" been lost by modern girls? Maybe all the good directors have retired or died! What a pity...Why, I couldn't even muster a stiff upper lip as I played this DVD through to the end. In spite of my being a certifiable "dirty old man". [:-)
Did anyone else watch the same movie that I did? Or should I say try to watch the same movie that I did? I am a huge classic sci-fi movie lover and had heard good things about this one. I was mislead. I can seriously think of no redeeming value to this movie. In fact, I am sure that Carpenter and O'Bannon are quite ashamed of this black scar that lingers in their past. The unwitty dialogue tries to be clever all throughout the movie and is just sooo boring. The 'effects' don't exist, and the whole alien beach ball thing is just embarrasing. It's not funny - it is embarassing. I could make a better movie with a handycam in my garage
YES! I agree with the other reviewers! This is the one VanDamm movie I LOVE and when I found it in my one used shop I was so extatic I never looked to see screen format! I never though that it would be Full Screen@!#!*!%!!!!! Ye Gods! it totally ruins that wonderful sceen in the kitchen of him doing the splits! Hey ya I'm a red-blooded female...and I can go OUCH at that scene too! that stunt hurts to do and man.....Whistle.....Looks very nice! The cropping really really ruins the impressive impact of that scene and I've not see the picture since it first came out it was really a Disappointment when I saw FULL SCREEN Come on UNIVERSAL!!! WE WANT WIDE SCREEN! FULL PICTURE!!!! this is a fantastic action picture and a crying shame to see it in full screen only!!!!!
How sad and pathetic this concert is.I loved the Dolls but this dvd is so bad it almost diminshes their legacy.After seeing how good the Stooges reunion concert was I was hoping for more of the same ...wrong!!It becomes painfully clear from the start that Johanssen in particular is phoning it in.Low point of the show is when they make "Human Being" [one of the greatest rock-n-roll songs ever] a sing-a-long.Give me a break!!!!
This is one bad movies. I am a devout horror fan, but I was unable to find one redeeming point in this movie. The acting is worse than bad, it's a joke. The plot is so far beyond lame as to be ridiculous. Save your money. Even the cinematography is utterly unimpressive. There is no humor, no likable characters, not even a decent quote or one liner. by the time it ambles toward its pathetic excuse for a conclusion, you will wishing you were in a theatre so you could demand your money back. So save yourself disappointment and keep looking, this movie is the biggest bomb, I have stumnbled across in years.
I have to say I had no expectations going into this movie, I watched it with an open mind, ready for anything. What I got was movie that not only managed to make me want to go to Wales, but also made me want to wail for hours because It was a waste of time. I am just confused about the whole thing really, the plot the characters the ending.....I see other reviews on here about how "creepy" it was, and I just didn't feel that. What I felt was an extreme hatred of the main woman played by Maria Bello (who I have never thought had a face or talent for acting) What they tried to do was take some made up legend of an otherworldly plane, where the dead go, and we can get the dead back if we give something living. The daughter is whisked away like Penelope taken to Hades but with much less interesting results. The mother and father, now have to take care of a displaced spirit child, her haunted freaky father, and a bunch of sheep that just need to be shorn and turned into a nice Ikea blanket for me. Are we supposed to care for this mother who hits her daughter, goes out and parties to the extreme enough to where the father abandons his family to go live amongst the obviously na�ve and gullible local folks? (Who worships in an abattoir? C'mon people) none of these folds deserved children, much less a ghost one. So when the mother realizes that she sucks, and decides to make the ultimate sacrifice to get her daughter out of underworld foster care I didn't really care, I was thinking the girl was much better off. I was also bothered by the girls attempted suicide and the fact that the father had no idea about it, what mother is so selfish that she keeps something so horrible from the father, because her daughter asked her too? Um, maybe what's wrong in this family is that No one communicates!!!!! Oh, wait, they all flipping know Morse code so that's enough?!?! There aren't any genuine scares, and sheep with glowing eyes aren't scary unless you happen to like eating lamb chops and feel guilty about it. The ending , both of them, didn't leave a good feeling or bad or even tie things all together, it felt rushed. I don't understand Hollywood's obsession right now with creepy children, it's an echo of the days of "the bad seed" and "the omen" but not homage, more like terrible copycats with no "oomph". So see this movie If you like Sean Bean, he is the only good thing about it, other than that see it to cheer when Maria Bello hurls herself off a cliff.
(1) Scarlett O'Hara is the least likable "heroine" I've ever seen. She has no redeeming qualities. (2) We're supposed to sympathize with the South and feel nostalgia for the good old days when white folks could own black folks? (3) This movie is way too long and dull. (4) I'm glad they burned Atlanta to the ground. (5) There was nothing honorable or respectable about the Old South and the plantation way of the life. The "gentlemen" were nothing but racists who thought they were aristocrats because blacks did all their work for them. (6) I'd rather watch "Mandingo" than this racist garbage any day of the week
Ignore the blurb on the VHS box, the movie is not about a couple's hot parties with hip friends, it is about a couple's awful parties with jerk friends. Now, that might not be a bad thing -- in fact, I think it could be easier to make a good movie about bad parties than about good ones -- but the advertising is dishonest. Much worse, though, is the the pointless and boring character of the movie, which is about a bunch of stupid or verbally sadistic "friends" who mostly don't like each other. While I've known cliques that keep getting together despite frictions between some members, it's inconceivable that these people would keep getting together for these abusive and tedious holiday events. Also, the couples' relationships, which come and go between these parties, are unexplained and mostly unexplored, as are some individuals' character changes, and indeed, almost everything that doesn't happen at the parties themselves
This should have been better but Angela Bassett's performance was the best, so I guess it's worth a watch
Others have already described the movie; so I shall not repeat what has already said. Dumont makes a movie, somewhat reminiscent of the late 60s early 70s "road" movies, in which a couple, gets in a car and drives off, to nowhere in particular. I hated those movies, but at least, in those movies the emotions the characters exhibited had some kind of rationale to it. Here the emotions are totally disconnected from reality, have nothing to do with what is going on in the screen, and seem only to be there to move the plot, if there is one, along. Katia, the girl, who seems quite psycotic if you ask me, keeps getting angry for no reason whatsoever; for instance, she entices pair of dogs to follow their moving car, then gets p#$sed at her boyfriend, when he hits one of them. By the time the movie approaches its dismal end, I did not care anymore how the director was going to wrap it up. The DVD includes a "Director's note of intent" (always a bad sign) A mix of Felliniesque dialog, blended with Sun Tzu; not a good combination. At the end of the "note of intent" the director finishes with "Envisage this film only in relation to the means employed and so only work from instinct" Well, instinct will not get you a viewable movie; I don't think you could make a worse movie, if you were trying to achieve it. It is not the violence or sex, other movies have that but still have some redeeming values, photography, artistic creation. There is no redeeming value in this. Just a waste of the DVD plastic.
I purchased this video to get ideas for a yoga fusion class that I'm designing. Boy was I dissapointed! This film is for spectators and posers, not for serious Yogis. You can barely hear Shiva's cues over the music. The video is so focused on being 'cool', that it totally fails to instruct, cue, or demonstrate poses. Anyone who has never done yoga would be totally lost. And as for the trance dance....I was not entranced. The problem was that Shiva was very tight and I didn't get a sense of freedom from her. There was one guy that seemed to be 'in the moment', but for the most part the trance dance was quite silly. Not a good instructional video. All glitz, no substance
Unfortunately, I was sent a standard American copy of the movie which, of course, doesn't function on a european system, despite my adress beeing in Switzerland. So I was kind of disapointed to have a)lost the money b)not been able to watch the movie. One is wrong to assume that every european household is having an american compatible DVD player.
I like Pauley Shore I have seen him in other movies that I liked so I made the mistake of buying the Jury Duty video because I liked In The Army Now and Bio-Dome and assumed I would like this too, well I learned my lesson well and I learned it the hard way and wasted my money and I have learned to never assume I will like a movie because I liked the actor in another movie and from now on I will rent the movie first! Jury Duty simply was just plain awful with it's weak, boring plot and unfunny humor! In The Army Now and Bio-Dome were a lot funnier, and if you want to kick back, relax and laugh your [backside] off than watch those movies
HEY GENIUS. GOOD JOB RUINING THE END OF THE MOVIE FOR ANYONE WHO HASN'T SEEN IT. LIKE, SAY, MY FIVE YEAR OLD AND EIGHT YEAR OLD CHILDREN. IT'S A MIRACLE IF I CAN EVEN GET THEM TO SIT STILL FOR FIVE MINUTES, AND NOW THAT THEY KNOW THE ENDING TO THIS FILM, THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE EVER GOING TO AGREE TO GO TO BED TONIGHT. THANKS A BUNCH. EVER HEARD OF THE INTERNET BEFORE? YOU MUST BE A FIRST TIME USER.
Here we go again. Another of my favorite shows starts repeating itself and treating the fans like idiots. The differences between season 3 and this drivel are STAGGERING. They must have swapped out writers or something. How else do you explain the camera lingering on Lana Lang's MANY revealing showers for no reason? Let me say this as clearly as I can: Showing skin on Smallville doesn't work!! Good Points: Michael Rosenbaum is still the best Lex Luthor ever put on film. Sarah Carter as Alicia Baker is back! She's Clark Kent's interim girlfriend, like a psycho Lori Lemaris (who cares if she tried to slice n' dice Lana last season and it makes NO sense for Clark to be within 50 miles of her? I don't). There are two new supporting characters this time, Lois and, erm...Jason. I weep for Jensen Ackles. He's way too good of an actor to be put through this horrible role. The way he takes a dumbly-inserted character like Lana's New Boyfriend and immediately makes him likable deserves him an emmy or something. Erica Durance as Lois: EASILY the worst actress, and her lines don't help. I don't really mind, because Erica LOOKS like Lois, even if her snarky remarks reach a cheese grater-level annoyance. I think Lois would work better if she just STAYED in Metropolis and we saw her only through Chloe. But I guess it's cheaper to keep her on the regular set. Personally I think it's a conspiracy to give Allison Mack less screen time. Why doesn't she get a revealing shower? Bah. ****THINGS THAT MAKE MY BRAIN HURT:**** 1.) Clark (somehow) becomes a quarterback for the football team. You get to see it for five episodes. What drama. Ok, this is just stupid. He's CHEATING, OK?? It's CHEATING. He can't just switch off his powers when he wants to. Clark's football career also results in the episode "Recruit", which is hazardous to your health. 2.) Turns out Lana's part-witch. I thought she was Native American? Nah, just French. And a CRINGE-worthy villain. 3.) PRODUCER: "Hey, doesn't this show remind you of Charmed?? WRITER: "Not really, but great idea!! Lets dress Lois, Lana, and Chloe is corsets and make them shoot purplish energy balls from their fingers!" 4.) If the writers weren't going to keep Jason around for more than one season, why put him in the credits?? Durr. 5.) Jane Seymour shows up in for the most pointless guest appearance in TV history. She does nothing for a few episodes then cashes her paycheck. Bye. 6.) 'Jynx', 'Spell', 'Recruit', 'Sacred', 'Spirit' and 'Ageless'. Oh right, and 'Forever'. ALL LAME! They make me ashamed to watch the show! Some are so awful I don't think I've ever watched them more than once. That's like HALF the dvd set. Bah. Oooohh, I wonder if Clark and Lana are gonna get together this season! Just they like get together and break up EVERY season! I'm on pins and needles! The ONLY things keeping this from 1 star are the excellent first couple of episodes. Oh yeah, Hey writers, stop ripping off other successful shows and movies! Morons
First off, let me explain why I purchased the AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS DVD in the first place, sight unseen. One, I was trying to collect as many notable films of the 1950's as I could on DVD, to add to my personal library. Two, it was the winner of the 1956 Best Picture Oscar (how bad could it be, right?). And third, it was on sale at my local wholesaler. So I figured, what the hey, I'll take a chance. Talk about a COLOSSAL disappointment. I'm a huge movie buff. I'm only 32 years old, but I love all sorts of films and genres from different periods and countries. I love old black and white and silent films, and I don't shy away from foreign films either. I'm also a huge fan of Warner Brothers' 2-Disc Special Edition DVDs. I try to keep an open mind about all the films I see, but I just can't come up with any convincing arguments to either buy or watch this film/DVD. To start, there is NO GOOD REASON why this film should be 3 hours long. It could have very easily been edited down to 2, if not 90 minutes. There is almost no script to speak of, and what little there is consists of trite exchanges and banter with barely 2 memorable lines of dialogue. There are endless shots of open seas or country, followed by about 30 seconds of dialogue, followed by EVEN MORE endless footage of different locales. There is no real drama or comedy going on to drive the film, and the pacing is absolutely DREADFUL... I found myself hitting the "fast-foward" button on my remote on more than a few occasions, simply because I knew I wasn't missing any dialogue and the establishing shots would go on for 1 or 2 minutes STRAIGHT! Secondly, the entire cast is virtually wasted. David Niven is always a delight to watch, but is never given a chance to make Fogg truly shine. He has one demeanor that he holds throughout: stiff and mannered, with little or no variation. Cantinflas, who supposedly was one of the highest paid comedians in the world at the time 80 DAYS was produced, gives us little reason to believe how or why he was such a sensation (other than doing his own stunt work). He's mildly amusing at best, and his accent is so thick and mumbled that I had to rewind and replay some scenes with the "subtitle" button on. As for the "noted" cameos... again, the actors/comedians are given little to do and barely play to their strengths and familiarity. The only cameo actor who stuck out as having any real performance or impact was the great John Carradine (can't miss that voice!). It's hard to believe it took THREE different writers to come up with such a frustratingly bland, lifeless and unfunny script (not to mention headscratchingly illogical... when Cantinflas rescues the Shirley MacLaine Princess character, wouldn't she fall in love with HIM, her actual rescuer, rather than the cool and distant Fogg, who only ordered the rescue? Talk about a missed opportunity for some genuine comedy!). Although this film obviously has some fans, I wonder if it's only because of some overriding nostalgia factor, whether it was seeing it for the first time back in 1956 or on TV as a child. Other than that, I can't understand how anyone could seriously recommend this film. Yes, it's beautifully photographed, and the costumes are great, but THAT'S IT. I can't believe that 80 DAYS won the Best Picture Oscar of 1956, a year that also gave us GIANT, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, THE KING AND I, THE SEARCHERS... hell, even FORBIDDEN PLANET or INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS should have won before this overblown moving postcard. I'm sorry to say that I probably won't bother watching this film again and will most likely end up reselling my DVD copy (if anyone will take it!). Certainly my most disappointing DVD purchase EVER. Don't say you weren't warned!
This final season is just ridiculous...and not in a good way. When the Wayans abandon a project, then you know it is unfunny and over. Just look at the Scary Movie films. Kelly Coffield left because the producers wanted to use Alexandra Wentworth more. A huge mistake! Kelly was hilarious. Save your money and avoid this stinker season
When shows do final seasons usually they go out with a bang. But saddly this shows last bullets in this shows gun was a bunch of blanks. Now dont get me wrong, it was funny, I'll give it that, that's the only reason it got 2 stars, but season 1-4 raised the comedy standeard so high and were so funny but this season was a huge failure IN LIVING COLOR wise. So I'd recomend this for the series collectors like me. meaning I have season 1-4 and although I didnt like season 5, I'd feel uncomplete without it
This is a wonderful film. Some may say it's a bit slow paced and perhaps it's not geared for the MTV generation's pace of visual stimulation. Nonetheless, patience has it's rewards for anyone who cares to take a chance. It appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the director, Tati. Unfortunately, the video transfer on this edition is so terribly soft, as though the telecine was not in focus. It's a crime that such a great film could not have been treated with greater care. One only hopes that a DVD transfer of superior quality is in the pipes
The book of Acts is a book of power! Sadly, this is what is lacking in the DVD presentation. The minute I began watching I knew it was going to be a weak (acting) rendition of the story. Thankfully, it is word for word from the Bible, which is why I gave it two stars. Reading through the book of Acts one can almost feel the electricity of the Holy Spirit working in and through the lives of the Apostles and believers. All of that is lost in the DVD presentation. I would not recommend this DVD. Stick to the Book instead
I did watch that and I did not liked cause I know good detailed information about this history. This DVD is making polishing Boeing company instead Lockheed won this techonology war ! It is 2 hours long and Boeing appears most of the times. There is no good explanation how Lockheed is performed that outstanding job. It all talkes about Boeing and at the final it again declares Boeing bla bla good bla bla succesfull at stealth jobs. I think the director was from Boeing Compan
I don't know what to say about this...it was interesting but not wowing by any standards. It was semi-enjoyable to watch with interesting graphics and the concept is novel too. But the music SUCKS and thats half the DVD right there. Recommend renting or borrowing from a friend. I wouldn't buy this DVD again
Ok, I'll addmit this had some pretty stunning moments here and there but other than that this was a yawn. This film is trying to jump on the japanese horror bandwagon. It really doesn't take a genius to figure out this plot. I mean as soon as the main actress enterred the cabin and heard her husband in the next room I turned to my girlfreind and told her the whole film's plot and sure enough I was right on the money, only I thought it would of ended 20 minutes earlier but oh no, it had to keep going and going...just end allready, I get it!
I am a big fan of martial arts films -- having lived in Taiwan. However, this one was over-hyped in my opinion. The love affairs in the DVD were unbelievable at best and even absurd at times. I often enjoy the melodrama and over-acting of Chinese films, but I gagged a few times on this one. It was down-right goofy at times. I really wanted this one to grab me, but it did not.
While it may be true that the "camera doesn't lie," when you take 600+ hours of footage and edit them down to 6, you have a lot of leaway to manipulate. Immediately after finishing the film, I would have given this movie 4 stars. It's very well crafted and kept my wife and me fascinated for all eight episodes. After we finished watching it, however, we wanted to know more, so we started gathering information from other sources. Very quickly, we discovered that we had been conned. Jean-Xavier de Lestrade clearly knew what would make a compelling story, and he crafted the footage to tell that story. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be the real story. We felt so betrayed. We'd spent 6 hours watching what was purported to be the truth only to discover that huge amounts of evidence had not been shown (much less explained) and that the documentary clearly was more spin that revelation. If you want to see a well-made film that will keep you amazed and guessing, definitely see this film. If you want to see something that reflects reality, I would look elsewhere
